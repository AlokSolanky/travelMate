		<h2>5. Visit the Ellora Caves in Verul</h2>
	</div>
	<center>
	<div class="img_space">
		<img src="images/misc/ellora_caves.jpg">
		<p>This complex of vertically-excavated Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monolithic temples in India's Maharashtra providence illustrates a spirit of tolerance characteristic of ancient India. 
		Covering an area more than 2 kilometers in size, the Ellora Caves are a massive and humbling tribute to faith and medieval-era workmanship in India. 
		In fact, the term “caves” hardly does justice to the 34 Buddhist, Brahmanist and Jainist temples in Ellora, each painstakingly carved out of the mountainside and filled with delicate works of art.
		Many of them put much easier-to-construct buildings to shame with their elaborate design, demonstrating both the strength of religious conviction that went into their creation as well as the highly skilled craftsmen who participated. 
		It is a feat that would be difficult to match even with modern techniques, and of course far less likely to be undertaken due to the cost and time it would take to create it.
		The caves feature art, temple and habitation space from three different religions, proving the level of tolerance and cooperation among the disparate religious groups in India at the time of their creation.

		<p>
		In the depths of North-Eastern India, within sight of the India-Bangladesh border, in one of the wettest places on earth, bridges aren’t built—they’re grown.
		The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm, crisscrossed by swift-flowing rivers and mountain streams. 
		The living bridges of Cherrapunji, India are made from the roots of the Ficus elastica tree. 
		This tree produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks, or even in the middle of the rivers themselves.
		One special root bridge, believed to be the only one of its kind in the world, is actually two bridges stacked one over the other and has come to be known as the “Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge.”

		<p>In a city famous for its many palaces, the former Royal residence known as Amba Vilas is an exceptionally grand building among grand buildings.
		It is the fourth palace built on the same location since the beginning of the Wodeyar dynasty in 1399.

		The current palace was designed to be erected on the remains of the earlier palace, which was destroyed by fire at the wedding ceremony of princess Jayalakshmmanni in 1897. 
		Construction was completed in 1912.
		<br>
		At night 97,000 light bulbs transform the building into a glowing spectacle.
