(1, 'Agra', 'https://www.oyorooms.com/travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Best-time-to-visit-Agra-3.jpg', 'When most people think of Agra, it’s the Taj Mahal that instantly comes to mind. While it is true that the grand, marble mausoleum is the city’s star attraction and the one that draws most tourists to this corner of Uttar Pradesh, the city does have a lot more to offer those willing to stick around for longer than a day.\r\nMany of the city’s sights are a result of centuries of Agra being India’s centre of power. In 1501, Sikander Lodi built his capital here until when, in 1526, the Mughals defeated the last Lodi sultan and took over his reign. However, most of the city’s most impressive structures were not built until the mid 16th and 17th centuries when successive emperors constructed the fort, the Taj Mahal and all of the major mausoleums.\r\nWhat we’re left with today is a city that is steeped in history and dotted with some of the most intricate and impressive structures you will ever lay your eyes on, all concentrated on this small bend in the holy Yamuna river.\r\nWhere to Stay in Agra\r\nZostel\r\nAfter 3 days ay Zostel, I can’t find anything to fault it. Situated just 10 minutes walk from the Taj Mahal’s east gate, it is in the perfect location for sightseeing and there is the added bonus of a large, outdoor garden space. To the front of the property is a small cafe/restaurant serving delicious masala chais and a great palak paneer. However, the highlights for me are the friendly staff and the almost-as-friendly hostel cat.\r\nWhere: Taj East Gate Road, Opp. 132 KV Sub Plant\r\nPrice: Bed in a four-bed dorm £3; Double or twin room with AC £19\r\nGoStops\r\nAnother of India’s more popular hostel chains, GoStops is a little more modern and spacious than Zostel and the dorms are cleaner and brighter. However, the private rooms are slightly more costly than Zostel and the walk to the Taj Mahal is a little further.\r\nWhere: 121, MMIG, Taj Nagri Phase 1\r\nPrice: Bed in a 6-bed dorm £4; Double or Twin room from £23\r\nWhere to Stay in Agra\r\nSheroes Hangout\r\nSheroes Hangout is more than just a cafe. It is a symbol of bravery and a fight against stigma and discrimination. Run by 5 acid attack victims – Rupa, Neetu, Ritu, Geeta and Chanchal – this initiative by the Stop Acid Attacks Campaign gives women that have been disfigured in heinous attacks a chance recover from the debilitating blows to their self-esteem by integrating and being in public rather than living a life of obscurity. Sheroes is a relaxed and colourful spot, with the walls covered in street art and portraits of acid attack victims. Just make sure to book a table as it is one of Agra’s most popular spots.\r\nTaj Ganj Rooftop Restaurants\r\nAgra is not known for its vibrant nightlife and the closest you will get to a rager is having a Kingfisher or two with your meal or in the hotel/hostel bar. However, if you want to enjoy a beer with a view, then head to one of the many rooftop restaurants in the Taj Ganj Area of the city. I tried the rooftop of Hotel Saniya Palace and the view of the taj mahal was spectacular. The majority of the restaurants around Taj Ganj don’t carry an alcohol licence, however, if you ask nicely they will soon find you an ice cold beer. Just be warned, the food probably won’t live up to the view.\r\nOberoi Amar Vilas Hotel\r\nKnown to be the best hotel in Agra, the Oberoi is the perfect place to treat yourself to a fancy, but overpriced, breakfast after a long morning exploring the Taj Mahal. Backpackers may feel a little out of place but it is worth walking inside to experience the sheer opulence. Plus, they have a fantastic bar and a terrace with views over the Taj.\r\nThe Best Things to do in Agra\r\nTaj Mahal\r\nMany people have tried to describe the Taj Mahal’s beauty. Shah Jahan, the buildings creator said “it made the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.” Rudyard Kipling said “It is the embodiment of all things pure” and Rabindranath Tagore described it as a “teardrop on the cheek of eternity.”\r\nThis may all seem like extraordinary hyperbole, but I am sure that the vast majority of the Taj’s 3 million annual visitors will tell you that it is all true.\r\nThe Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his 3rd wife who died in childbirth in 1631. The emperor was so heartbroken that he began building the Taj Mahal in her honour. The main mausoleum took just 8 years to complete, but it wasn’t until 1653 that the finishing touches were added to the complex as a whole. Because of this, it is often described as the world’s greatest monument to love.\r\nOpen from sunrise to sunset every day except Fridays, when the site is only accessible to people attending the mosque.\r\nEntry fee: 1100 Rs for foreigners, 40 Rs for Indians.\r\nTIPS FOR VISITING THE TAJ MAHAL\r\nThe best time to visit the Taj Mahal is at sunrise when the crowds are smaller and it is still cool enough to comfortably walk around. I would advise getting there half an hour before opening to ensure that you are near the front of the queue.\r\nEnsure that you buy your ticket before joining the queue. The ticket booth is on your right-hand side as you walk towards the east gate along Taj East Gate Road.\r\nAlthough you can enter at the South, East and West gates, the queues tend to be shorter at the south gate as fewer tour groups arrive at this entrance and the fact that the ticket office is nearly a 1km walk from this gate.\r\nOnce you get inside, you will see most of the other tourists gather in front of the main reflective pool, trying to jostle each other for a photograph of the mausoleum. I recommend walking straight past them and heading to the mosque on the west side of the complex. You will possibly be the first there, giving you the opportunity to photograph the taj with no other people.\r\nItimad-ud-Daulah\r\nThe Tomb of I’tim?d-ud-Daulah has gained the nickname of ‘The Baby Taj’ over the years due to the similarities in stonework and carvings between the two. What many people don’t know is that Itimad-ud-Daulah was actually built before its more famous counterpart and was the first mausoleum to be built from white marble rather than red sandstone. It may not be as grand as the Taj Mahal, but it is just as beautiful.\r\nAgra Fort\r\nAside from the Taj, Agra’s most impressive structure is this red sandstone relic of the Mughal era. Its construction began along the banks of the Yamuna in 1565 by Emperor Akbar and was later embellished with white marble by his grandson, Shah Jahan. What was once a sprawling, a military fortress was transformed into a palace during his reign.\r\nWhat will strike you most about the fort is its scale. It is 2.5km in circumference and the walls get as high as 20m at some points. Once you get inside, the interior is as impressive as the outer walls. Here you will find stunning structures such as the Shish Mahal (mirror palace), Khas Mahal, Diwan-e-khaas (hall of private audiences), Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) and Nagina Masjid (Gem/Jewel mosque). My advice would be to spend an entire morning or afternoon wandering the various buildings to get everything you can out of your visit. Just make sure to peek out of the rampart windows to catch a distant glimpse of the Taj Mahal.\r\nMehtab Bagh\r\nOne of the most mesmerising views of the Taj Mahal is from the Mehtab Bagh gardens on the Yamuna river’s north bank. Mehtab Bagh is beautiful; a long, lush green lawn dotted with flowering bushes designed to mirror the Taj Mahals own decorative gardens. Legend says that Mughal emperor Shah Jahan long planned an exact copy of the Taj to be built in the spot as a tomb for himself, only made entirely of black marble. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son, Aurangzeb, before it could be built.\r\nThe perfect time to visit is just before sunset, settling in for a view of the Taj as daylight fades, casting an orangy pink glow on the building’s marble dome. I spent a beautiful evening, sat in complete silence with dozens of other people, gazing in awe at history’s greatest monument to love.\r\nAlthough it is only a few hundred metres from Agra’s centre, getting there and back is a 16 km round trip, taking 20 minutes each way and costing around 150 rupees on an overpriced tuk-tuk. It requires travelling a few kilometres west of the city, crossing the Ambedkar bridge, and then making your way back eastwards to the Taj Mahal viewpoint.\r\nEntry fee: 100 Rs\r\nKinari Bazaar\r\nAgra isn’t the kind of place that suffers from a lack of retail options. All around the old town, the Taj and in Sadar Bazaar you will find gift shops and emporiums trying to hawk you all kinds of tat; bags, clothes, marble ornaments (be warned as these are often not real marble), gems and tiny models of the Taj itself. I even saw multiple stores selling Taj Mahal snow globes despite the city never experiencing snow.\r\nHowever, if its a more local experience that you’re looking for, head to Kinari Bazaar. This crazy labyrinthine network of alleyways and chouks situated behind Jama Masjid is a colourful assault on the senses. Just make sure to take plenty of patience as the crowds and onslaught of sales pitches can be a little overwhelming.\r\nOpen Wednesday – Monday, 11 am – 9 pm\r\nTake a Boat Ride on the Yamuna River\r\nOfficially, it’s illegal for tourists to take a boat ride on the Yamuna. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s impossible, you just have to know where to look and who to ask. After all, who would want to miss out on the best view of the Taj Mahal just for the sake of a few rules?\r\n\r\nMost hostels in and around Agra offer this tour (200-250 Rs per person) but I found that the best way is to do it yourself from Dusshera ghat. To reach Dusshera ghat, head to the Taj Mahal’s east gate from Taj East Gate Road and, as soon as you pass the ticket office, take a right and follow the Taj’s perimeter wall all the way to the waterfront. As boat rides are not advertised, it is best to ask around at the jetty to see if anyone will take you. When I visited, there were a few policemen on the jetty but they didn’t seem to mind me hopping aboard a boat. For the best view of the Taj, visit at sunset or sunrise.\r\nWe paid 100 rupees (around £1.10) each for a 15 – 20 minute ride.\r\nTaj Nature Walk\r\nJust a short walk from the Taj Mahal down the East Gate Road sits this lush expanse of parkland, crisscrossed by walking trails, picnic spots and viewpoints. The nature reserve covers 70 acres, stretching from the road towards the banks of the Yamuna and you can expect it to be fairly quiet compared to the rest of Agra if it is a little peace and tranquillity that you’re looking for. I only spotted two other couples walking the trail while I was there.\r\nWhile it is great for twitchers and nature lovers, the real attraction is the various vantage points dotted around the park, allowing to see the Taj Mahal from a unique perspective. It’s possible to spend a whole morning exploring the different paths but I found that an hour was enough time.\r\nEntry Fee: 100 Rs. for foreigners, 20 Rs for Indians.\r\nGetting In & Out of Agra\r\nThe best way to reach Agra from both Delhi and Jaipur is by train.\r\nAround 20 trains travel between Delhi and Agra each day, most of them leaving from Delhi’s main station and arriving at Agra Cantt. The journey can take anywhere between 2 and 4 hours. If you plan on getting to Agra and back in a day, the Bhopal Shatabdi Express departs New Delhi at 6 am, arriving Agra Cantt at 7.57 pm. The return leg departs Agra Cantt at 8.30 pm, arriving in New Delhi at 10.30 pm.\r\nThe fastest train – and the one that I chose to take to Agra – is the Gatimaan Exp, taking only 1 hour 40 minutes. It leaves Delhi at 8.10 am and arrives at 9.50 am. Both these trains are the more expensive options but if you’re willing to have a longer journey, you can catch any of the other trains for around half the price (700-800 Rs). Check Cleartrip for an up-to-date timetable.\r\nThere are two trains that you can catch from Jaipur to Agra, the Ald Jp Express and the Kurj Udz Express, taking 4h 45 and 5h 50 respectively. The Ald Jp Express leaves Jaipur at 3.20 pm and makes the return leg at 7.15 am the next day. The Kurj Udz Express leaves Jaipur at 6.15 am, returning from Agra Cantt at 6 pm.\r\nAgra Cantt lies southwest of the Taj and Agra Fort, which are both just a short ride away by car or tuk-tuk. The pre-paid taxi stand at the station charges a flat rate of 150 Rs to any hotel in the city but it may be possible to haggle for a cheaper ride on an autorickshaw.\r\n'),
(2, 'Agra', 'https://www.oyorooms.com/travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Best-time-to-visit-Agra-3.jpg', 'Why you need to visit Agra\r\nWhen people think of Agra they think of India’s most famous monument – the iconic Taj Mahal regarded as the most beautiful building in the world. However, it would be hard to find two places more juxtaposed, the city of Agra is nowhere near as beautiful or serene as the Taj but its still an essential stop on any Indian adventure and part of the famous Golden Triangle.\r\nI managed to get through the gauntlet of touts and souvenir sellers at the station and in the narrow streets outside the Taj Mahal relatively hassle free and I did not find Agra to be as horribly filthy or smelly as people had warned us, but maybe I’m just too acclimatised to India by now!\r\nMany visitors understandably make a beeline for the Taj Mahal but there much more to see here. Agra can easily be visited on a day trip from Delhi, either as a tour or independently on the new fast train that takes only 1 hr 40 mins and by road its about 3/4 hours drive. But doing it this way is a long day and you will be rushed, you will miss some of the city’s other sights and won’t get to witness the amazing sunrise over the magnificent Taj.\r\nDid you know that Agra is also the only city in the world that boasts three UNESCO World Heritage Monuments!  It deserves much more than a quick day trip! I recommend spending 3 days in Agra.\r\nContinue reading my Agra travel guide for the top things to do, places to stay and eat and more tips for visiting The Taj City. \r\nTop Things to Do in Agra\r\nThere are many wonderful things to do in Agra and there are some great tour companies within the city that can take you on a tour of the top sights. The best way to get a real feel for the city is to take a walk along The Mall Road, Taj Road or Fatehabad Road where you will find spice shops, leather shops, handicraft shops and plenty of food.\r\nTaj Mahal: There isn’t any sight more famous than the Taj Mahal and you’d be crazy to travel India and not see India’s most recognized monument and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. This famous monument to love and beautiful exercise in perfect symmetry really does live up to the hype as the most beautiful building in the world.\r\nThe Taj is actually a mausoleum, built in 1630 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal who died during child birth. It took 22 years and 20 000 workers to complete. The perfectly symmetrical monument is arguably the most beautiful monument in India and is one of the country’s most photographed sites. But photos, and words, just can’t do it justice, it is even more jaw-dropping in person. Read if I thought the Taj lived up to the hype.\r\nThe best time to see the Taj Mahal is at sunrise as the Taj ethereally reveals itself through the morning mist and then gradually changes colour as the light changes. The best place to get the perfect Taj photo is on the Diana Bench, where Diana, Princess of Wales was photographed in 1992. There’s also great views of the Taj from Agra Fort, Mehtab Bagh and the Taj Khema hotel.\r\nUseful tips for visiting the Taj Mahal: The Taj is the most expensive monument in India – it’s 1,000 Rupees for foreigners and 40 Rupees for Indians. Tickets can be purchased at the ticket offices near the entry gates.  There are three entry gates; West, South and East. The West is normally the busiest, the South is closest to Taj Ganj where many budget hotels are located. Opening and closing times vary depending on the time of sunrise and sunset, as well as the time of year. There are night viewings two days before, the night of and two days after a full moon, which is an incredible experience. No food, cigarettes, lights or tripods are allowed inside the Taj Mahal, and the frisking is heavy so just don’t bother bringing them. The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays.\r\nAgra Fort, another UNESCO world heritage monument, is an imposing red sandstone Mughal fort. Agra Fort is one of the finest Mughal forts in India and has an interesting history, first as a military fort constructed in 1565 by Emperor Akbar, later Shah Jahan (who built the Taj Mahal) transformed it into a palace before he was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb and ended up being imprisoned in Agra Fort where he could only gaze out over the river to see the Taj Mahal glistening under the sunshine in the distance.\r\nAgra Fort is similar to the more famous Red Fort in Delhi, but I actually enjoyed visiting Agra Fort more as it had more nooks and crannies to explore from a mish mash of different eras and is definitely worth a visit. visit and there is also an evening sound and light show that recreates the Fort’s history.\r\nMehtab Bagh – This 25 acre Mughal botanical garden complex on the opposite side of the river from the Taj Mahal offers good views of the monument, minus the crowds. The botanical gardens are open from sunrise to sunset and are perfectly aligned with the famous monument. It was the last garden built by the Mughal Empire and Shah Jahan himself saw it as an ideal place to view his beloved Taj Mahal. Entrance is 200 rupees for foreigners and 15 rupees for Indians. You can also get a rowing boat from near here.\r\nTaj Nature Walk – There is also a nice park and 9 km nature walk that you can take under the cover of the forest to get good views of the Taj from different mounds in the park and see various flora and fauna. It starts 500 meters away from the Eastern Gate of Taj Mahal and costs 50 Rupees for foreigners.\r\nKinari Bazaar – Right in front of the Taj Mahal are narrow streets and a maze of lanes that are filled with colour where you will find fabrics, jewellery, clothing, shoes and spices, as well as stalls selling typical Indian snacks. I felt like I was surrounded by millions of people, and there was still room for the cows and even the odd elephant. Walking around this area is definitely an experience that will open up all of your senses.\r\nAkbar’s Tomb – The resting place of the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great is in the Sikandra area of Agra along the Delhi-Agra Highway. The red sandstone tomb is beautifully decorated with carved rabbits, deer and langurs. There are also lovely inlaid panels with floral, geometric and calligraphic designs. These were later copied in Itmad-Ud-Daulah, which then inspired the design of the Taj Mahal.\r\nChini ka Rauza – The tomb of Allama Afzal Khan Mullah sits on the eastern bank of the Yamuna River and is known for its incredible glazed tile work. It is a bit off-the-beaten-path and I found that many of the local children were fascinated by me when I visited. The tomb has an unusual structure compared to the others in the city, which is a great reason to explore it!\r\nItmad-Ud-Daulah – Often called the baby Taj, the tomb of Ghias-ud-Din Beg was built by his daughter; Empress Nur Jehan. The marble mausoleum is also located along the banks of the river and consists of numerous outbuildings and gardens.\r\nWatch a Kalakriti Show – The story of making of Taj Mahal is performed in a dance drama every evening at the Kalakriti Cultural and Convention Center, not far from Taj Mahal. It’s a multi-lingual show with a huge replica of Taj Mahal lit up with multi color lights.\r\nVisit a village – A community based tourism initiative called the Mughal Heritage Walk has been set up to improve villagers lives by making an income from tourism. In Kachhpura village you can visit a number of relatively unknown Mughal era monuments and see the village communities as well as get a fabulous view of the Taj Mahal. You can also visit Korai Village, a tribal village on the way to Fatehpur Sikri, whose inhabitants were the keepers of dancing sloth bears\r\nAgra Tours\r\nIf you do want to Agra as a day trip from Delhi then if you are willing to leave at 2.30am this private tour gets you to Taj in time for the magical sunrise before having breakfast at a fancy hotel and seeing Agra Fort. If you don’t want to get up so early this private tour takes you from Delhi to Agra to see the Taj and Agra Fort.\r\nAgra Magic run good day trips from Delhi and tours within the city, including a bazaar walk and tours to the less well known Agra sights and trips to Fatephur Sikri. \r\nAgra Walks run lots of fun cultural walking tours, including food tours and cookery classes, Agra by night tours and yoga sessions facing the Taj.  \r\nDay Trips from Agra\r\nYou can also do some interesting day trips from Agra.\r\nFatephur Sikri – It’s an easy day trip from Agra to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Fatephur Sikri, an 16th century city that was once the capital of the Mughal Empire. It was abandoned after only 15 years because of the insufficient supply of drinking water there. Fatephur Sikri is home to one of the largest mosques in all of India and is one of the country’s best preserved examples of Mughal architecture. \r\nThe impressive Buland Darwaza at the entrance of the city is made of red sandstone, and ornamented with black and white marble. Also check out Jama Masjid, which was one of the first buildings to be built in the complex, and the Tomb of Salim Chishti that sits within its courtyard. There’s also the five-storied Panch Mahal and Mariam-uz-Zamani’s Palace, which was home to Akbar’s Rajput wives.\r\nTickets cost 510 Rupees for foreigners and 40 Rupees for Indians. It takes about an hour to get there on the local bus or you can take a day tour. You can also visit the World Heritage-listed Keoladeo National Park (formerly known as the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary). This private day tour goes to both Fatephur Sikri, the bird sanctuary and also visits a rural village. Or, if you are also going to Jaipur then this great value tour combines seeing Fatephur Sikri, the impressive Abhaneri stepwells and a private transfer to Jaipur! \r\nMathura and Vrindavan – Explore the holy side of Agra by taking a day trip to the holy cities of Mathura, which is said to be the birthplace of Krishna and Vrindavan. Mathura is one of the seven Hindu holy cities and one of the heritage cities chosen for National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY). Visit the sacred Keshav Dev Temple and Vishram Ghat, where it is said that Krishnu rested after killing Kansa. Mathura’s twin-town of Vrindavan is where Krishna spent his youth and also has lots of temples to visit, including Prem Mandir. There are also numerous temples dedicated to Radha Ramana.\r\nWhere to Stay in Agra\r\nThere is, no doubt, a need to offer tips for places to stay in Agra. There are lots of budget accommodations in Taj Ganj, which, although a little grotty, is close to the Taj Mahal. There are also budget options in Rakabganj not too far from Agra Fort. The Fatehabad Road area is a little bit more upmarket with some comfortable mid-range accommodations.\r\nSave: The Best Backpacker Hostels and Budget Guesthouses in Agra\r\nMoustache Hostel – is located in a really cool building that looks like a palace. It offers clean, uniquely designed dorms and private rooms that are excellent value for money considering its great location just 2kms from the Taj Mahal. It is a popular hostel with a nice rooftop area, a restaurant and plenty of colourful communal areas perfect for socialising with other backpackers.  The staff are friendly and helpful and there’s plenty of fun activities on offer too.  \r\nZostel Hostel – is another good backpacker hostel option. A clean, cheerful hostel in the heart of the Taj Ganj area near the East Gate with air-conditioned private rooms and 4-bed dorms. Some rooms have a private balcony with views of the city or the hostel’s gardens. There is a common room for meeting other guests to tour around the city with. There’s also a pretty good restaurant and garden.  \r\nHotel Sheela – A clean, comfortable and popular budget hotel with 22 fan and air-conditioned rooms. The location is excellent, its just 300 meters from the Taj’s East Gate but in a quiet area. There’s a peaceful and pretty decent garden restaurant and the staff are super friendly.  \r\nHotel Kamal – Another clean, comfortable guesthouse with 16 private rooms that sits just 5 mins walk from the Taj Mahal’s East Gate. Rooms have a private bathroom, cable TV and air-conditioning, staff are good and the highlight is the rooftop restaurant which offers magnificent views of the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort.  \r\nAman Homestay – For a more personalised experience in Agra it is well-worth the little bit more it will cost to stay at this lovely homestay situated in a quiet area but still within easy reach of the Taj . Rooms are plush, spacious and comfortable with satellite TV and large terraces. The best feature of this accommodation is the family that runs it, the fantastic vegetarian meals and the great homely atmosphere.  \r\nHotel Castle View – A cosy, mid-range hotel that sits on a quiet street off of Fatehabad Road. All rooms are spacious and nicely decorated and have flat-screen TV, private ensuite bathrooms and  coffee/tea making facilities. The staff are humble and helpful.  \r\nSplurge: The Best Luxury and Heritage Hotels in Agra\r\nIf you want to splash out on a luxury hotel Agra is a great place to do this with romantic characterful heritage hotels with views of the Taj Mahal. My favourite two are:\r\nGrand Imperial Heritage Hotel – A heritage hotel right in the city centre where all 30 rooms are named after the great Kings, Queens and Princes of India. You will actually feel like royalty while you fall asleep in a four-poster bed and wake up looking out at the swimming pool or the manicured gardens. There is a fantastic terrace restaurant to enjoy a meal and the views of the Taj Mahal.  \r\nOberoi Amarvillas – If you want a memorable and romantic place to stay that matches the grandeur of the Taj then look no further than this stunning fort like luxury hotel. It has exceptional views of the Taj Mahal to mirror the exceptional service and grandeur décor. Each room is expertly decorated with wood floors, a king size bed and a floor-to-ceiling window that has fantastic views of the famous monument. Guests can dine under the stars or on their private terrace, as well as at one of two restaurants. There is a lounge that serves tea and a bar for sipping on a single malt, a glass of wine or a signature cocktail. The grounds are just as amazing as the rest of this property. \r\nWhere to Eat and Drink in Agra\r\nAgra is known for its chaat, petha and dal moth and vendors offer these cheap local snacks at every turn. There is not much in terms of fine dining in Agra apart from in a few of the extremely upmarket hotels, though there are some good restaurants in the Sadar Bazar area.\r\nMany guesthouses in the Taj Ganj area have rooftop restaurants with views of the Taj Mahal and, although there isn’t really any nightlife in Agra, most touristy restaurants will be happy to sell you a beer, often under the table or in a tea cup as many budget places don’t have a license. You can also head to one of the more upscale hotels to have a drink.\r\nSome of the best restaurants in Agra include:\r\nSaniya Palace Hotel – One of the best rooftop restaurants with fantastic views of the Taj Mahal, good food and a relaxing atmosphere.\r\nJoneys Place – Great spot for quality breakfast in Taj Ganj. It is a small restaurant but the masala chai and lassi are excellent.\r\nSheroes Hangout – An initiative by the Stop Attacks Acid campaign. The menu is simple but food is good. The café is run by survivors of acid attacks and gives them the confidence to carry on. There’s also a small library and shop.\r\nCafé Coffee Day – Great escape from the heat near the Taj Mahal. The air-conditioned café serves coffee, tea, ice cream, cake, burgers and sandwiches.  \r\nTreat Restaurant – A popular place for travellers on a tight budget. It is a small place but the breakfast and thali is pretty good.\r\nBamboo Café – A popular place with a very large menu that serves a great breakfast and top quality curries from all over the country.\r\nYash café – Chilled out café with wicker chairs and good breakfast thalis. On the first floor above shops close to the Taj Mahal.\r\nLakshmi villas – Great spot for affordable, good south Indian cuisine. Décor is bare and staff are not the best but if you are craving south Indian cuisine this is the place to go.  \r\nEsphahan – The finest restaurant in Agra is located in Oberoi Amarvillas. The fine dining menu is said to have recipes that were passed down from the Mughal emperors’ kitchens and includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. There are two sittings (6:30pm and 9:30pm) and you don’t have to be a hotel guest to dine here.\r\nPeshawri – Another fine dining option that is known for its rich flavours and beautiful atmosphere found in the ITC Mughal hotel. It has an award-winning menu with prices to match and is a good choice if you like Mughlai cuisine.\r\nHow to get to Agra\r\nAgra is well connected to other nearby cites in North India. You can take a car here in about 3 hours but the best way to go is by train. There are two train stations in Agra, the main one is Agra Cantonment. Express trains run daily from New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway stations in Delhi to Agra, the fastest takes just 1 hour 40 mins.\r\nSee More info here on getting to Agra from Delhi. Also, read my ultimate guide to train travel in India for more info on how to book train tickets.\r\nYou can also reach Agra by bus, regular buses go to Delhi and take 4-5 hours. There are also overnight buses to Jaipur, Hardiwar, Gorakhpur and Lucknow.\r\nThere are auto rickshaws available outside of the train and bus stations that will take you to Taj Ganj for about 120 Rupees. A cycle rickshaw will be around 50 Rupees. Walking is the best way to get around, but apart from that, the best way to get around the city is by cycle or auto rickshaw but be sure to agree on a price before you head off.\r\n'),

This symbol of undying love is one of the seven Wonders of the Modern World and one of the most beautiful buildings in India, so like countless travellers before us, we too made the long journey to see it with our own eyes. (Spoiler alert: it lived up to every single expectation and then some!)\r\nSince our month in India was all about travelling at a slow and leisurely pace, we gave ourselves three full days in Agra (we later learned that most people only stay a night or two!), and fortunately for us, that meant we got to see and do quite a bit around the city. Now here’s a look at how we spent our 3 days in Agra:\r\nAgra Travel Itinerary\r\nTour Agra Fort on foot\r\nAgra Fort was the main residence of the Mughal emperors before they moved their capital to the Red Fort in Delhi, so if you’ve already been there on your travels through India, it’s kind of cool to see some of the similarities between the two structures. \r\nLike the Red Fort in Delhi, Agra Fort is also a walled city and inside the enclosure you’ll find gardens, palaces, mosques, audience halls, and basically a maze of marble and red sandstone. If you’re interested in the history of the fort, you can easily hire a guide at the gates, however, it’s also the kind of place that you can enjoy on your own.\r\nThe cherry on top is that because Agra Fort is located just 2.5 kilometres from the Taj, you get some pretty cool views of it as well!\r\nAdmire the Baby Taj up close\r\nAlright, so you’re not going to get any views of the Taj Mahal from the baby Taj, but if you’re already heading to Mehtab Bagh, this stop is right along the way.\r\nThe Baby Taj, whose real name is the Tomb of I’tim?d-ud-Daulah, is a mausoleum that was commissioned for Mirz? Ghiy?s Beg; he was the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal, the woman the Taj was built for.\r\nThe Baby Taj has been regarded as an early draft for the Taj, but I personally don’t see the resemblance – I think Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi offers a better representation of that! But what I can agree with is that the Baby Taj looks a bit like a jewelry box. From a distance the building may appear to be solid white marble, however, when you get up close you can see that it is covered in arabesques, geometric patterns, and colourful semi-precious stones!\r\nCatch sunset at Mehtab Bagh\r\nAnother place you should make time for in Agra is Mehtab Bagh, which also goes by the ever romantic name: Moonlight Garden.\r\nAside from offering a quiet respite from Agra’s busy streets, these gardens sit directly behind the Taj Mahal and right across the Yamuna River, which means that once again you get some postcard perfect views.\r\nThis location is really popular at sunset, and couples, families, and tour groups were already starting to gather across the lawn long before the sun went down.\r\nLegend has it that Emperor Shah Jahan, who commissioned the Taj Mahal, had wanted to build a mausoleum of black marble for himself in these very gardens to mirror the Taj Mahal. As history would have it, Shah Jahan’s own son ended up throwing him in prison, which meant this plan never came to pass, but can you imagine what that would look like today?\r\nGet close to nature on the Taj Walk\r\nOne of the biggest surprises in Agra was the Taj Walk, also known as the Taj Protected Forest, which is located just before reaching the East Gate.\r\nThe Taj Walk is a mix of paved paths and dirt trails, where you can spot peacocks roaming wild, however, the crowning jewel of the park are the free views of the Taj Mahal! They have a few benches scattered across the grounds and every once in a while you’ll come across an unexpected hill that offers views of the Taj dazzling in the sunlight.\r\nBecause the park is located east of the Taj, you get the best views in the morning when the sunlight hits the building. You can still visit in the afternoon, but the Taj will be backlit – something to keep in mind for all you photogs out there.\r\nEnjoy a meal with a view of the Taj\r\nSaniya Palace Rooftop Restaurant calls itself “the restaurant with the best views of the Taj Mahal”, and while I didn’t try every restaurant in town, I can’t really argue with that statement either because the views were pretty spectacular.\r\nThis restaurant is located on top of a guesthouse by the South Gate and you have to huff and puff your way up several flights of stairs, but once you reach the top, you can see the Taj Mahal framed by pastel buildings.\r\nThe food did take a long time to arrive (we waited 45 minutes) and it’s not going to win any awards (expect standard Indian fare), but if you’re in no rush, the rooftop is a nice place to linger while you enjoy views of the Taj just a little bit longer.\r\nVisit the Taj Mahal itself\r\nAnd now I’ve saved the best for last: seeing the Taj Mahal up close!\r\nWhat can I say about the Taj Mahal that hasn’t already been said before? The structure is striking from the minute you first set eyes on it.\r\nWe decided to skip the early morning wake-up call for sunrise, and made our way there at 9:00 a.m. without any rush. We were visiting on a weekend, but there were no lines at the East Gate, so we went through security and were standing in front of the Taj within minutes.\r\nWe spent the entire morning walking along the complex, gawking at the building’s beauty from every angle, and taking a gazillion pictures because you never know when you’re going to be back! If you’re planning on visiting, I would suggest you give yourself at least 2-3 hours to explore every nook and cranny.\r\nStay within walking distance of the Taj\r\nOur hotel in Agra was my favourite property of our whole month in India, so I just have to write about it! We stayed at a place called The Coral Court Homestay, which is a boutique hotel with a familiar touch.\r\nThe property was run by a travel-loving couple who had a colourful home filled with trinkets from around the world. I loved that wherever I looked there was an unusual artifact with a story, be it embroidered silk pillows with elephants, tinted glass lamps dangling from the ceilings, or shelves and coffee tables piled with books in foreign languages. It was like setting foot in the home I’d like to have one day. \r\n \r\nAside from being a beautiful property, it was also within walking distance of the Taj Mahal while simultaneously being in a quiet area just off of Taj East Gate Road. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Agra, I would highly recommend this hotel!\r\nLastly, they served breakfast, lunch and dinner in a communal dining area where guests could mix and mingle, while swapping tales from their travels across India.\r\nTo wrap things up, I’m really glad I had three full days in Agra to sightsee without rush and tack on some lesser visited attractions. That being said, if you are on a tighter schedule, you can still pack quite a bit into a day or two, especially if you hire a rickshaw driver to take you around, so either way, you’ll enjoy your visit.\r\n'),
(4, 'Agra', 'https://www.oyorooms.com/travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Best-time-to-visit-Agra-3.jpg', 'I woke up at 3:30 AM to prepare myself for the once in a lifetime trip, to see the sunrise at the Taj Mahal. My driver was right on time by 5:00 am and we drove for 15 minutes to the ticket booth to buy the entry ticket. Taj Mahal has the most expensive ticket of all the monuments in India. For foreigners, it will cost you around 750 rupees. If you are a citizen of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, your ticket will be cheaper. Since I\'m from Thailand which is part of the BIMSTEC countries, I was able to get the ticket for only 510 rupees. You will be distributed with a plastic bag which you will need to cover your shoes as you walk up to the Taj Mahal.\r\nAfter I got the ticket, I was told that no cars were allowed from this point on so I had to take a shared electric bus to the western gate of the Taj Mahal. As I walked to the gate, there was a little line full of foreigners waiting to see the Taj Mahal. I thought there would be more but I guess it was a good idea to travel during the monsoon season.\r\nThis is the western gate where I went through. You will have to run through a security checkpoint before you are able to enter this sacred place.\r\nThis is me right after I enter the western gate. From the clever way the monument was built (towers leaning outward), it creates an illusion that makes the Taj Mahal looks bigger as you started walking through the inner gate.\r\nI heard many people grasped at the beauty of the Taj Mahal as they approached. Hell, I even mumbled \"wow\" without know it. This place is just freaking beautiful. This place blew all the other monuments I visited and hands down one of the most memorable experience I ever had traveling alone.\r\nThe Taj Mahal up close. The flowers are carved into the marble, the way they did in the marble factory I visited on my third day in India.\r\nInside there are 2 tombs, the Shah Jahan\'s tomb and his wife. Unfortunately, taking photos inside is prohibited, so this was all I got, the exit. :(\r\nHere\'s the thing about about traveling solo, I can do whatever I want. I just sat on the side enjoying the view of the river and people walking and talking for hours. It was one of the most peaceful moment I had in India. A great break from a busy cities.\r\nAfter 2 hours of admiration of this massive structure, it was time for me to leave. A look back at the gate.\r\nSights like this are very common in India. We went back to the hotel, had breakfast and headed out for a 45 minutes trip to Fatehpur Sikri.\r\nAfter 45 minutes ride, we\'ve arrived at the Fatehpur Sikri, remote monuments consisted of 2 sections, the palace (tickets required) and the mosque (publicly accessible). The mosque part is open to public for praying and as you may have guessed, I was bombarded with touters trying to sell me stuff. It was not as peaceful as the palace part where I can walk freely without being bothered by anyone.\r\nThis is me through a star in one of the walls in the mosque area.\r\nInside the palace complex. As you can see, there weren\'t many people around which was perfect for me. The area is huge, and I spent hours enjoying the corridors of these ancient city.\r\nAfter 2 hours well spent here, I left and headed to Jaipur (4 hours drive). I was surprised when the driver told me that he will be taking me to his family living in Dausa, Rajasthan. I didn\'t mind at all since it was my chance to see how the locals really live in India. It was a welcomed surprise.\r\nAs I walked into a very narrow green corridor, racing up the stairs I was met with this little shy boy (who enjoyed getting his photo taken). My driver (Ram) introduced his little cousin and all members of his families.\r\nAfter 30 minutes resting at Ram\'s place, It was time for me to continue my journey to Jaipur. This is what I have always been looking for in a trip like this, a local touch. Seeing how the locals actually live is the best reward I could ever get. Such a memorable experience.\r\nAfter 2 more hours drive, we arrived at Jaipur or the Pink City. The first thing I noticed was the city is much cleaner than in Delhi and Agra. We arrived at the Rani Mahal hotel, a very well decorated heritage hotel, at 4 PM and I was told that the surrounding is quite dangerous for a foreigner to walk alone since the hotel is located in a middle-class neighborhood. I was feeling super tired at that point so I decided to rest and ended the day early.\r\n'),
(5, 'Agra', 'https://www.oyorooms.com/travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Best-time-to-visit-Agra-3.jpg', 'The third apex of iconic Golden Triangle travel loop, along with Delhi and Jaipur, Agra is a must-see stop in India. Home to that jaw-dropping mausoleum of white marble, the Taj Mahal, Agra is no one-trick pony. Many people come in on a day trip from Delhi, but if you can, stick around for a while. Come for the utterly magnificent Taj, but stay for the many other worthwhile sights in and around the city. Here’s all you need to know for getting there, getting around, and what to do once you’ve landed.\r\nGetting to and from DEL\r\nMost people get to Agra by way of Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and then take a train to Agra. Once you arrive in Delhi, there is a metro service that runs from Indira Gandhi Airport to New Delhi Railway Station that departs every 20 minutes. From the railway station, taking the train to Agra is your best bet. There are several trains that run between New Delhi Railway Station to Agra Cantonment (Cantt) Train Station, including the 12002 New Delhi Bhopal Shatabdi Express, which takes around two hours to get to Agra.\r\nGetting around Agra\r\nThe best way to get around Agra is by auto-rickshaw because they are plentiful. You’ll have to agree on a price before you get in, however (friendly) haggling is usually necessary. Expect to pay anywhere between INR 100 and 200. Depending on your budget, taxis are also an option for getting around the city, but are more expensive than autorickshaws.\r\nAgra does have public transport, but it’s very limited and we don’t recommend it for tourists. If you do decide to take a city bus, the cost is about INR 20 and only cash is accepted.\r\nIt is generally safe to walk around Agra, but note that the major tourist sites are far from each other. Also note that when moving about the city, it is essential that you wear modest clothing; this means your shoulders and knees should be covered. Also watch your personal belongings, no matter whether you’re walking or in an autorickshaw.\r\nThings to do in Agra\r\nSince there’s really no way to have a list of things to do in Agra that doesn’t include the Taj Mahal, we’re starting with the Taj Mahal. You’ve read about it, you’ve seen photos, you’ve heard other people describe their experience of the awe-inspiring site, but if you’ve never been, it’s time to change that. Nothing can really be said about the massive mausoleum complex that hasn’t been said already, but suffice to say, prepare to be blown away by gleaming white marble and intricate architecture. The UNESCO World Heritage site took 20 years to build and stands as a dedication to the favourite wife of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after she died giving birth to their 14th child. It’s best to go in the morning when crowds are thinner, but expect gobs of people no matter when you go. Don’t let that deter you though; you’ll be too busy being awed to care.\r\nAlso know as Moonlight Garden, Mehtab Bagh is one of the most scenic spots in Agra and can found directly across the river from the Taj Mahal. The location of the centuries-old garden complex affords amazing views of the Taj from almost every angle, so make sure you have your camera.\r\nAnother UNESCO World Heritage site (albeit a somewhat overshadowed one), Agra Fort is well worth a visit once you’ve made your way around the Taj Mahal. Located just northwest of the Taj, this is one of India’s most historic structures from the Mughal era. Agra Fort is actually about a century older than the Taj Mahal and makes for an interesting day of exploring. This place is well laid out but huge, so wear comfortable shoes.\r\nAround 40 kilometres west of Agra you’ll find Fatehpur Sikri (meaning Cup of Victory), a fortified ancient city that’s well worth getting out of the city to see. The sprawling complex of monuments and temples was built in the second half of the 16th century and served as the capital of the Mughal Empire for 10 years. This is also where you’ll find one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid.\r\nShop and eat your way through one of Agra’s many markets and bazaars to pick up some souvenirs or simply soak up the atmosphere. Some of your best options include Raja Ki Mandi, Rawatpara Spice Market and Kinari Bazaar — a tangle of narrow stall-filled streets behind Jama Majid.\r\nAgra Day Tours\r\nLooking for more things to do? Urban Adventures offers a day tour from Delhi to Agra, plus several other Delhi tours led by local experts who will give you a taste for local life:\r\nDelhi to Agra Day Tour\r\nBreathtaking views, nostalgic stories of chivalry and romance, and impressive architecture make up this full-day adventure to Agra! You’ll see iconic sites like the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, and hear the stories and legends behind the lavish lives of the Mughal emperors.\r\nDelhi Food Walk\r\nGo beyond the cliched curry and try some authentic Indian bites on this Delhi tour. From homemade ice cream to fruit beer and dumplings, Delhi’s food scene is thriving and surprising.\r\nMade In Delhi\r\nMingle with locals and store owners, try delicious street food and discover the best places to shop for exquisite fabrics, kurtis and souvenirs. This shopping mecca is jam-packed with emporiums, showrooms, handicrafts, museums, street food stalls and bars, all waiting to be discovered!\r\nWhat’s on in Agra\r\nIf you’re in Agra in February, you must attend the Taj Mahotsav fair, when artisan and handicraft vendors from all over India come to display their goods. The cost is INR 20, and you can get information about it from the local tourism office.\r\nFrom March through August, you can check out the show at the Kalakriti Cultural Convention Centre, which showcases the different cultural dance forms of India. The cost is INR 1,500.\r\nAgra on the big screen\r\nSee Agra on the big screen by watching Jodha Akbar, a historical romance about a Mughal emperor and Rajput princess. Agra was the capital city of the Mughal Empire and still contains many Mughal-era buildings.\r\nYou can also watch Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire — the famous film about an Indian boy’s survival in the slums… as told through flashbacks when he appears on India’s version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Although the setting was primarily Mumbai, the lead character briefly works as a tour guide at the Taj Mahal.\r\nAgra on record\r\nGet ready for a trip to Agra by getting your hands on some traditional Sufi music, which you can listen to here.\r\nAgra in books\r\nRead up on Agra before you go by picking up a copy of Taj Mahal: Passion and Genius at the Heart of Moghul Empire by Diana Preston. This book gives you insight into the history and making of the magnificent Taj Mahal.\r\n\r\n');

(7, 'Amritsar', 'https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/g1r87p.jpg', 'Draped in rich history, culture and traditions, Amritsar is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Sikhs across the world and welcomes tourists with open arms. You’re embraced by the bustling streets, the aroma of food cooking in the open-air kitchens and strains of devotional music the moment you step into the lively by-lanes. \r\nHere is all you need to know about Amritsar! \r\nThe City: Then and Now\r\nThe Sikh Warriors\r\nFounded by the fourth guru of Sikh faith in 1579, the city derived its name after Guru Ramdas built a pool on a land he purchased from the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Believed to provide riddance from sins with a dip in the holy water, the Amrit Sarovar surrounds the revered Golden Temple in the midst of it. The city has been associated with various mythical and historical incidents and finds mention in scriptures such as the Ramayana. \r\nLeading the educational and industrial sectors in the past, the situation, however, was quite different during India’s Freedom Struggle. Though the city managed to keep intact its legacy and traditional values, it was scarred by an inhuman attack which was sparked with the arrest and deportation of two popular local leaders, Saif-ud-Din Kichlew, an advocate, and Dr. Satyapal, a medical practitioner. This led to tension, which culminated into incidents of violence and repression of political activity. On April 13, 1919, the Sikh New Year (Baisakhi), a large meeting was called for at Jallianwala Bagh. Soon after the meeting, General Dyer ordered his troops to block the only exit and fired 1650 rounds of ammunitions for 10 minutes continuously. Hundreds of innocent men, women and children were killed and over a thousand were wounded. This tragic event left a deep mark on the Indians and mobilized mass participation in India’s fight for independence.\r\n \r\n Bullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh | Photo Credit: Rakshakdua/wikimedia Commons\r\n \r\nA trip to this enchanting city is bound to leave you in absolute awe. You’ll never know until you go!\r\nThings to Do While You’re Here\r\nDo\r\nGolden Temple:\r\n\r\nThe Harmandir Sahib, famous in the world as the Golden Temple, is the holiest shrine of the Sikh faith. Boasting of a stunning architecture, the dome on the upper section is gilded with about 100 kilograms of pure gold, which gives the temple its name. \r\nCherish your opportunity to offer a prayer in the central hall and revive in the vibrance of spirituality that emanates from every corner of the magnificent structure. Make sure you cover your head at all times within the temple premises. Don’t miss to feast on the delicious langar at the common kitchen with hundreds of people sitting in long rows. Take a dip in the holy water here and volunteer your help to the staff members for a fulfilling experience. ??\r\n \r\n\r\nJallianwala Bagh:\r\nThis revived public garden that runs for a stretch of about 7 acres is the site of 1919 Amritsar Massacre. Bullet marks on the garden walls are a testimony to the barbarity of an act that took 379 lives. The garden also encloses a well where many people including children jumped to save themselves from being shot. While here, observe a minute’s silence for all the departed souls and families that were left scarred by the tragic events. \r\n\r\nWagah Border:\r\nA short scenic drive away from Amritsar on the Grand Trunk Road, Wagah Border marks the Radcliffe Line, which is the demarcation between India and Pakistan and was drawn during the partition of India in 1947. The flag-lowering ceremony that takes place every evening where soldiers from both sides try to outdo one another as the crowds cheer on, this is accompanied with an interactive patriotic session. Playing of the National Anthem is the best part of the day and is enough to fill anyone with great pride and is an experience not to be missed.\r\nChange of Guard Ceremony at Wagah Border\r\n \r\nEat\r\nThough Langar ka Prasad from the Golden Temple tops the list for foodies, you can also try the stuffed Kulchas with Chhole, Chur-Chur-Naan, Chhole Bhature and Lassi at Bharawan Da Dhaba. They haven’t been awarded ‘Punjab’s Number 1 Dhaba’ without a reason! You can’t afford to miss the Keema Kulcha with dollops of butter at the Friend’s Dhaba and the tastiest Fish Tikkas at the Beera Chicken House. \r\nCraving for more? Head to the Hall Bazaar to try the most amazing fruit cream and kulfa for dessert!\r\nBuy\r\nHall Bazaar doesn’t just pacify your taste buds but also allows you to shop for beautiful Phulkari embroidery work, jewellery and handicrafts which are a speciality of Amritsar. While you are at Hall Bazaar, visit the neighbouring Katra Jaimal Singh Bazaar to satisfy the shopaholic in you. The Old City Bazaar of Amritsar is worth a visit if you’re looking for an excellent place to shop traditional Indian wear, bangles, the famous Punjabi juttis and other trinkets. \r\nIf you’re searching for an ideal place to shop for jewellery and other adornments, look no further than the Guru Bazaar in Katra Ahluwalia that offers a great variety of options to choose from. Conclude you shopping spree with some Pashmina shawls at the Lahori Gate Market which happens to be the perfect place for a delicious dinner too!\r\n'),

It felt like all of them were swerving around me in tuk-tuks, looking intently and asking for selfies.\r\n\r\nThe city centre feels open and modern but it only takes a few turns to feel totally off-grid in a maze of muddy, noisy alleyways.\r\n\r\nDue to the local vibe with lots of cheap eateries (plus the free entry and food at the Golden Temple), Amritsar was one of the cheapest places for backpacking in India.\r\n\r\nA quick history of Amritsar\r\nBefore we explore the many things to do in Amristar, let’s touch upon the city’s rich history. Over 500 years ago, the land Amristar is built upon was bought for 700 rupees. Bargain!\r\n\r\nGuru Amar Das, the fourth Sikh guru, constructed Amritsar around a man-made pool that was to become the Golden Temple. For many years, it was a wealthy city known for music, arts, performance and philosophy, perched at an optimum location for trade.\r\n\r\nSadly when the British came to rule, Amritsar was drained of its rich assets. The city crumbled like many in India.\r\n\r\nOther events that have shaped Amritsar’s history include the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre where the British shot dead hundreds of innocent civilians, and Operation Blue Star, the standoff between the governments and militant Sikhs inside the Golden Temple. The government killed 83 Sikhs and the prime minister was subsequently assassinated by her two Sikh bodyguards. A bloody history, to say the least!\r\nGetting to Amritsar\r\nAir: I arrived in Amritsar by air from Thailand. While most people arrive into India via Delhi, if you’re in Asia already, Amritsar is a good starting point.\r\n\r\nTrain: Amritsar Junction station will connect you by train to other cities including Delhi with 7 hours.\r\n\r\nBus: From Amritsar, you’re well connected to the mountainous area of Dharmshala where lots of people go next. To catch a bus there (no trains run for this route), check 12Go Asia.\r\nThings to do in Amritsar\r\nRather than hundreds of activities, there are just a few main things to do in Amritsar. None were remotely similar to things I’ve done elsewhere so it was a memorable trip for me, even if I didn’t particularly love the city itself. Starting with the most obvious one, these are my top things to do in Amritsar…\r\nThe Golden Temple\r\n\r\nAs the world’s most important Sikh pilgrimage site, you can expect the Golden Temple to be busy. There are signs telling you not to take photos but, to be honest, everyone is!\r\n\r\nThe one place you really can’t take photos is inside the Golden Temple itself but, depending on the length of the queue, you might not even go inside. I did during a rainy evening when the line was relatively short but usually it’s 1-2 hours long! It was very atmospheric inside with lots of decadent details and locals at worship, but it really depends how long you’re prepared to wait.\r\n\r\nVisiting the Golden Temple is free. You have to remove your shoes and don a headscarf which can be borrowed at the entrance.\r\nEat at the Golden Temple Kitchen\r\n\r\nA weird and wonderful experience in Amritsar is dining at the world’s biggest community kitchen which feeds 100,000 people a day. This is known as a langar to Sikhs.\r\n\r\nI loved this experience because it was so unique: we sat cross-legged on the floor with a delicious dinner and hundreds of locals doing the exact same thing.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know, caring for others is a big part of the Sikh religion. Community kitchens are a common theme in temples around the world. You won’t pay a penny for this meal which I think is so amazing and hospitable.\r\n\r\nYou’re presented with an empty tray and servers come around to dole out scoops of dahl, curd and chapatis. I loved the efficiency of it all, including the water machines that pour into your cup without the staff having to bend down!\r\n\r\nFood is available all day in the Golden Temple dining hall, so just arrive and make your way over there.\r\nVolunteering at the Golden Temple\r\nOne of the most interesting things to do in Amritsar is volunteer at the Golden Temple Kitchen. Here, you’ll help chefs prepare the food in bulk. I’d suggest doing this as part of a tour because your guide will know the chefs personally and help you get the best of the hectic environment.\r\n\r\nI booked a tour with Incredible Amritsar and sadly had to cancel when I came down with food poisoning. It would have been awesome to stir the giant dahl pot and see hundreds of chapatis flipped by the industrial-sized dough machine. Next time!\r\nThe Golden Temple evening ceremony\r\n\r\nIf you get the chance to visit the Golden Temple at night, I’d highly recommend it. While the daytime is better for photo opportunities, the evening is more atmospheric.\r\n\r\nEvery night at 9.30pm, the Palki Sahib ceremony sees the Sikh holy book, Guru Granth Sahib, get put to bed inside the temple. Temple guards carry it there while music plays and a crowd gathers, so it’s an interesting ceremony to see.\r\n\r\nI’d suggest arriving at the Golden Temple around 8pm. Eat a meal in the kitchen, then wait for the show afterwards. The best way to spend an evening in Amritsar!\r\nThe Wagah Border Show\r\n\r\nDespite the first four items in this blog being about the Golden Temple, there’s one other very cool thing to do in Amritsar.\r\n\r\nEvery day at 4.15pm in the winter and 5.15pm in the summer, the border between India and Pakistan hosts a colourful, competitive dance show. Hundreds visit to cheer for India each day, and you’ll glimpse people supporting Pakistan on the other side of the border.\r\n\r\nAttending the Wagah Border show was honestly one of the coolest and most random experiences I’ve ever had travelling. And that includes the time I watched a dance show in a Filipino jail then played badminton with the convicts!\r\n\r\nEveryone was in great spirits and the high-energy dance show was just amazing. Expect elaborate costumes and some impressive high kicks.\r\n\r\nOur show begun with an energetic march and dance party from a hundred young patriotic Indian girls. We got up out of our seats and joined them!\r\n\r\nI visited the Wagah Border, which is an hour’s drive from Amritsar, as a tour with my hostel. However, it’s easy to visit by taxi or tuk-tuk.\r\n\r\nEvery day in the central square, guides will hassle you with trips to the show, charging around 1,000 rupees per vehicle. Try and split the ride with other travellers if you can, especially because it’s more fun in a group. The show is free to watch.\r\n'),
(9, 'Amritsar', 'https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/g1r87p.jpg', 'Travel blog on Places to Visit in Amritsar in Two Days\r\nThis is a detailed article to help you plan your itinerary for Amritsar. I had written this report for my own travel blog which is unfortunately no longer operational. Hence I am posting this article here in this forum so that it can help anyone who is planning to visit this holy city. It’s a pretty long article, so thanks in advance for your patience. I hope you like it.\r\nThe holy city of Amritsar was beckoning me for quite some time. I am not a religious person. In fact the only time I remember “The Almighty” is when I am feeling low about things in life. However, there is something about the sights and sounds of Amritsar which tugs at your inner spirituality. I wanted to visit Harmandir Sahib popularly known as the “Golden Temple” in Amritsar. I also needed to get away for a two day break from my routine activities. With this in mind, I decided to plan my two day itinerary for Amritsar.\r\nThe last time I visited Amritsar was in the year 2006. At that time I had stayed in one of the accommodations managed by the authorities of Golden Temple. The market area surrounding the temple premises was chaotic, dirty and noisy. The condition of the roads was bad and overall I could not handle the chaos of the city. I was relieved once the trip got over and I was away from Amritsar.\r\nMuch has changed in the city since then. The Punjab Government at some point must have woken up and realized that they really needed to do something for the “Holy City”. Amritsar on its own was fetching scores of tourists and pilgrims despite having inadequate facilities to cater to them. The Government opened its coffers and gave a facelift to the entire market area over a two km radius surrounding the Golden Temple. They widened the roads in other areas of the city, started regulating the flow of traffic and also spent huge money to restore other heritage sites in Amritsar. When I visited Amritsar this year in 2018 I could see the visible effects of the transformation the city had undergone.\r\n2018……it took a long time coming but I finally visited Amritsar again after twelve years. Over the last couple of years I had come across various travel blogs and videos on Amritsar. What I read and saw astonished me to no end as this was not the Amritsar that I had experienced. However, curiosity got the better of me when I finally decided to once again visit Amritsar. After researching various trip reports and travel forums (especially tripadvisor.com) I made a relaxed itinerary covering two days. Following are the details of the itinerary:\r\nDay 1:\r\nTake the early morning bus from Chandigarh (my hometown) and reach Amritsar by 11:30 am. Check in to the hotel by 12 pm. Relax, get ready and leave hotel by 01:30 pm.\r\nProceed for lunch to Kesar Dhabha. Have lunch at Kesar Dhabha and then proceed to Partition Museum and Jallianwala Bagh for sightseeing.\r\nBy late afternoon explore market area surrounding Golden Temple. Early evening proceed to Golden Temple and spend the rest of the evening there. Have langar at Golden Temple for dinner.\r\nDay 2:\r\nEarly morning start to the day. Do the “City on Pedals” bicycle tour from 07:30 am to 11:00 am. Return to the hotel to freshen up and relax for a couple of hours.\r\nIn the afternoon, proceed to Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum. Then visit Lal Mata temple.\r\nIn the evening proceed to Gobindgarh Fort. Spend a couple of hours over there and then proceed to Makhan Chicken Corner for Dinner.\r\nDay 3: Take the bus returning to Chandigarh.\r\nWith the itinerary mapped out, I went ahead and booked Volvo bus tickets online from Chandigarh to Amritsar. Since I was travelling alone, I wanted to enjoy this holiday on a budget. So I booked a room in a budget hotel at Rs. 900/- per night in Hotel HK Continental through oyorooms.com.\r\nDay 1:\r\nWell the day finally arrived and out of excitement I woke up an hour earlier than the alarm was set. I caught the early morning Volvo at 06:50 am. The bus journey was a breeze and by 11:15 am I reached Amritsar. I walked down to the hotel as it is hardly a km away from the bus stand. I was quite satisfied with the room offered at the hotel as it was a decent sized room (140 sq. ft.), neat and clean along with an LED television and AC. What more can one expect at Rs. 900/- a night? After settling in, I booked a motorcycle cab through “UBER Moto” to Kesar Dhabha.\r\nKesar Dhabha:\r\nLots has been said and written about this place which is located in the narrow by-lanes of Amritsar. I too wanted to try this place. The only way to reach here is through a cycle rickshaw, auto or a motorcycle taxi (Ubar/ OLA). No cars can enter these narrow lanes. The place although clean is non-descript and without any frills.\r\nI ordered a “Paratha Thali” for myself. The food when it arrived was literally swimming in “Desi Ghee”. It consisted of two parathas, one black lentil fry (dal fry), chickpeas (safed chana), raita (curd with small pakoda) and salad. The food was so rich in butter that my hunger died by just looking it. It turned out to be quite a task to finish the meal. I ordered Thums Up Cola to digest the heavy food.\r\nBeing a Sikh-Punjabi, I am used to Punjabi food. This meal was nothing special. It was like any other Punjabi dish although very rich in Ghee. The food tastes okay though and if you want to try Punjabi dishes then this place is worth a shot.\r\nPartition Museum:\r\nHaving eaten a heavy lunch, I decided to walk down to Partition museum as it was hardly a km away from Kesar Dhabha. The Partition Museum is located inside the Town hall building. The entry ticket to the museum costs Rs. 10/- for a domestic tourist but much more (Rs. 250/-) for a foreign tourist. I initially thought that this will be a small museum and I will cover the entire place in 15-20 minutes. How wrong was I? The museum although not very big, stores a wealth of information and it took me more than 90 minutes to explore it. I could have easily spent another hour over there. What I saw and observed shook me to my core. I finally came to realize the evil that this partition of India and Pakistan wrecked on our lives and our social fabric.\r\nIndia was hard done by partition there is no doubt about it. There are various exhibits in the museum which include photographs, newspaper cuttings, old audio clips (i.e. radio announcements during 1945-1948), video clips featuring television interviews and other artifacts to portray a complete and comprehensive picture of that dark period. Going through all the information, I realized that there are no simple answers on why partition happened. Most of us Indians blame Nehru and Jinnah for the partition of our country. We have a tendency to blame politicians for everything including partition. However circumstances on ground are far different from our perception of reality. What cannot be forgiven though is the way the present government of that time absolutely washed its hands off the communal carnage that followed. It is estimated that more than one million people died in these communal riots. People lost everything, their land, money and lives of close family members. They had to start building their life from scratch with negligible Government support. It was a painful period for people at both sides of the border. Hence i urge my readers to avoid indulging in loose talk whenever we are discussing a sensitive subject such as partition.\r\nWe are not allowed to take photographs within the museum. A pity since this information must be shared and showcased to the rest of the world. I also don’t like the fact that they are overcharging a foreign tourist so much. For all Indians, this attraction is a must visit in Amritsar. Go and see for yourself the pain of partition that has been so wonderfully depicted in this museum.\r\nJallianwala Bagh:\r\nMy next stop was Jallianwala Bagh. It is hardly a five minute walk from the Partition Museum. The Jallianwala bagh is a 6 acre public garden which has five gates and is walled from all sides. This garden is infamous for the massacre that took place on 13th April 1919.\r\nOn that fateful day, a crowd consisting of mostly civilians including women and children had gathered here despite the imposition of a martial law. These people were here holding a peaceful protest to condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders. Within no time the troops of the British Indian Army surrounded the garden, blocked all entries and opened fire on the hapless civilians. The firing continued for ten minutes. It is stated that around 1000 people died and 1500 were left wounded. This brutality shocked and galvanized the entire nation in such a manner that it became a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.\r\nI knew about the history of Jallianwala Bagh. When I entered the site and started exploring the things I was overcome with emotion. The place is clean, well maintained with washroom facilities and drinking water for the visitors. Throughout the garden there are seats in shaded corners available for people who want to rest. There are different spots marked clearly with notes on the history behind the spots. You will also view the bullet impressions on the wall marked clearly with white squares. There is a small museum within the garden which has newspaper clippings, photographs and articles related to this event. This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in Amritsar.\r\nInterpretation Center:\r\nHaving covered the Partition Museum and Jallianwala Bagh, I was now keen to spend the rest of my afternoon and evening at the Golden Temple Complex. So I arrived at the plaza where I spotted a small board outside. It displayed a notice about four high tech multi-media shows on Sikh faith and religion starting at 4 pm. I got curious and since it was the last show of the day I decided to check it out.\r\nThis center is built in the basement of the plaza and is fully air-conditioned. It was a relief to be here after walking for such a long period in the hot sun. The idea of this interpretation center is to brief visitors about Sikh religion and their philosophies. The first gallery gave a narration of the birth of Sikhism and its journey from the First Guru to the Ninth Guru. The second gallery showcases the historical events surrounding Harmandir Sahib. The third gallery gives you a glimpse of the activities within Harmandir Sahib. This gallery also features a 3d model of Harmandir Sahib. The fourth gallery provides holographic and video projections narrating the wisdom of Sikhism. You can also view the detailed architecture of the interiors of Harmandir Sahib.\r\nThe four shows were completed in about an hour’s time. I enjoyed my time here as the shows were entertaining, the venue was fully air-conditioned and I got a chance to rest here for some time. Moreover these shows are completely free of cost and I wonder why they don’t charge for it? My only gripe with this place is that the entire narration is in Punjabi without any English subtitle. So a non-Punjabi speaking tourist may not get any value from these shows. However this place is definitely worth a visit especially if you want to escape the heat of Amritsar.\r\nGolden Temple aka Harmandir Sahib:\r\nSri Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Darbar Sahib or Golden Temple is one of the most revered place of worship for Sikhs all over the world. This temple is intended to be a place of worship not only for the Sikhs but for people from all religions all over the world. The four entrances to the Golden Temple symbolize the acceptance of the Sikhs towards all people and their religion. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people visit this temple on a daily basis. The free community kitchen adjoining a huge dining hall proved 24/7 meals (langar) to lakhs of devotees all the year around. Vegetarian food is served here and people eat their meals as equals irrespective of their faith, gender or economic background.\r\nThe main temple is built on a 67 ft. platform in the centre of water tank (also known as the Sarovar). It is connected by a bridge which is 202 ft long and 21 ft wide. You will see long queues of patient pilgrims on the bridge waiting to pay their respects at the temple. After arriving at the temple complex, I joined the queue. It took me an hour’s time before I could finally reached temple platform. I saw the temple premises from inside, went on the upper two floors and then departed in half an hour. A quick note to the readers; be prepared to stand in line for 1-1.5 hours whenever you are visiting the temple.\r\nHaving paid my respects at the temple, I took a leisurely stroll around the temple complex observing the wonderful architecture. I must say that this temple is incredibly well maintained. The atmosphere of this temple is very spiritual and affects even nonreligious people like me. The soothing chants of the “Gurbani” and the devotion of the visitors add to the spiritual atmosphere of the temple. I finally sat down at the banks of the Sarovar and continued to stare at temple watching the changing hues and colors as the evening progressed into night. The view of the Golden Dome in the evening and night is a marvelous sight to behold enhanced by the shimmering waters of the Sarovar.\r\nGolden Temple Heritage Street:\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I wasn’t impressed with Amritsar when I had visited it years ago. To get to the Golden Temple was quite a task. You would be confronted with drain clogged streets, hawkers, pedestrians, auto and rickshaw pullers, all jostling with each other for space. Add to that the 45°C heat outside; your vacation would get over even before it started. Thankfully, the Punjab government realized that the Holy city was getting a bad name. Astonishingly, they renovated the entire market stretch around the Golden Temple Complex within one year. It is estimated that they spend around Rs. 1000/- crores in refurbishing the street and the markets.\r\nI spent a lot of time walking this stretch. The weather was a little hot in the afternoon and quite pleasant at night. I saw bright new lampposts, water fountains and statues against the backdrop of buildings inspired by Mughal and Rajput architecture. All the buildings sported a pink façade with identical sign boards. A proud statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh stands tall at Phowara Chowk. At the Saraghari Chowk, you will see the statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and a mini replica of the parliament. The pathways are lined with various plants and shrubs to give it a green look. In fact, this entire shopping stretch looks reminiscent of some street of an Italian city such as Rome or Florence.\r\nI was feeling quite happy when I finally retired to my hotel. Amritsar was so much better than what I had expected. Looking forward to the next day’s adventure, I welcomed some much needed sleep.\r\nDay 2:\r\nI woke up early morning at 06:00 am and changed quickly. I was participating in a bicycle tour of some heritage sites within the by-lanes of Amritsar. Feeling nervous and excited, I changed into my tracks quickly and called an Uber Moto.\r\nCity on Pedals (Bicycle Tour):\r\nThe City on Pedals bicycle tour is a great way to explore some forgotten and neglected heritage sites in Amritsar. It gives you an authentic feel and flavor of what the “Holy City” is all about in terms of culture, food, people and so on. The tour starts at 07:30 am and concludes at 11:00 am. During this period, you cover a stretch of 9 km negotiating the main roads and the narrow by-lanes of Amritsar. Along the way, you will view historical monuments, taste local Punjabi food and get to see local markets popular for their crafts and wares.\r\nI reached the designated pick up point by 07:20 am. Since I had not ridden a bicycle for over 20 years, I was really nervous. I met Rishab the owner of this venture. He along with two team members was accompanying me for this tour. Very soon I was saddled with a helmet and safety jacket. With the greatest trepidation I tried my foot at the pedal and immediately my bike was going all over the place. Rishab was patient with me in explaining the controls and soon I found myself pedaling the bike without much difficulty. After riding for some time on the road my confidence got better and I was able to negotiate the bumps and turns that came along the way. Our first stop was the Company Bagh; a sprawling garden which is home to the much neglected summer palace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Our next stop was the Khair-Ud-Din Mosque which was built in 1876. Despite being such an old mosque and heritage site, it looked a little neglected. We then proceeded to see other sites such as Qila Ahluwalia, Gurudwara Darshan Deori, Gurudwara Saragarhi Sahib and the famous centuries old Banyan Tree known as Baba Bohar.\r\nAlong the way, we stopped at various points to enjoy the Amritsar delicacies. I had the “Masala Chai” from the famous Giani Tea Stall. I also ate Puri Chana, Gur ka Halwa and Amritsari Kulcha during the course of the trip. The City on Pedals team seems to have done their homework well in the food department too. The meals were tasty and combined with the 9 km city tour this turned out to be a little tiring but thoroughly exhilarating experience. Hats off to these guys, they’ve come up with a unique and enjoyable way to explore Amritsar. Rishab and his boys go out of their way in making this tour an enriching experience for you. This attraction should be on top of every tourist’s list whenever they are visiting Amritsar.\r\nClick on the images above to view more pics of the City on Pedals Bicycle Tour, Amritsar)\r\nAfter the tour I returned to my hotel to rest for a couple of hours. I was looking forward to visiting my next stop, the Mata Lal Devi mandir.\r\nMata Lal Devi Temple:\r\nI can sum up my visit to this temple in one word…..WOW!!! At a first glance, this temple looks like a normal place of worship built in somebody’s house. There are various statues of Indian Gods and Goddesses on the ground floor. You can view it in two minutes. However, don’t be deceived by the appearance. The real journey begins when you take the stairs to the first floor. What follows is a labyrinth of stairs and corridors in a maze like structure which also involves crawling in low ceilinged caves. Along the way, you will see statues, murals, mirror paintings and color stained glass images of virtually all the Indian Gods and Goddesses in existence. You cannot turn back and only move forward. I took one hour to complete the whole journey as I was busy clicking photographs. This place is a delightful visit for tourists. They should come and see for themselves the brilliant outcome of Mata Lal Devi’s resolve (who by the way is also worshipped as a deity here).\r\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh Museum:\r\nMy next stop was Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum. The cost of the entry ticket is Rs. 10/-. It’s a small museum which gives a brief history of the greatest Sikh ruler of Punjab. It is surrounded by a well maintained garden which has the statues of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. On the ground floor you will view old paintings and life-size statues depicting some important events in Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s life. There is a room in which arms, armor, coins and manuscripts of that era are stored. On the first floor, you will get to see life-size 3D statues in a circular room depicting different wars that the Maharaja fought. The effect is that of an all-round panorama. At the background you will hear war-cries and sound of horses’ hooves as a part of sound effects. This museum is nice and worth visiting if you are not falling short of time in Amritsar.\r\nFort Gobindgarh – Places to Visit in Amritsar\r\nThis was my last stop in Amritsar. I reached here at 05:30 pm in the evening. This place is well known for its two shows; one is “Lion of Punjab” a 7D show of 15 minutes that goes on throughout the day and the other one is “Whispering Walls” a multimedia laser light and sound show which is viewed on the open ground at dark after 07:30 pm. I bought a ticket for Rs. 290 which allowed me to view both the shows. I spent close to three hours in this place. There are two museums inside which have replicas of the weaponry of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s time. Nothing great to see here but it is okay to pass your time. However I was here in the fort for the other attractions. The 7D show was an awesome hair raising experience. The live folk dance and Punjabi Martial Arts were quite entertaining. The light and sound multimedia open ground laser show was spectacular to the say the least. The colonial bungalow sitting in the middle of the garden literally came alive and started talking to us. We were strictly forbidden to take photos or videos. You have to see it to believe it. This attraction should not be missed by any tourist. It is best to visit the fort in the evening when you can view both the shows.\r\nMakhan Chicken:\r\nI had heard a lot about this place so I decided to dine here after completing my trip at Gobindgarh Fort. Took an “Uber Moto” to this place. I was under the impression that “Makhan Chicken Corner” will be some non-descript dhabha serving non-veg food. Turns out that this place is an upscale air-conditioned bar and restaurant. I was pleased with the ambiance. Feeling tired and hungry, I immediately ordered a beer, half tandoori chicken and fish-fry as per the server’s recommendation. Tandoori Chicken was okay, nothing special about it. The Fish Fry is really good. It has its own distinct flavor and complements the beer really well. I will recommend this restaurant to tourists who want to enjoy drinks in a decent atmosphere with non-veg food.\r\nThis was the last day of my visit to Amritsar. Returned to the hotel to get some much needed sleep and caught my pre-booked Volvo to Chandigarh the next day.\r\nOther Places to Visit in Amritsar:\r\nDurgiana Temple:\r\nWhile planning my trip to Amritsar, there were a couple of places to visit in Amritsar that I missed due to oversight and lack of planning. One such place is Durgiana Mandir. This is a Hindu Temple modeled on the same lines of “Harmandir Sahib”. The 700 year old temple sits in the middle of a water body connected by a bridge. Inside the temple there are shrines of Hindu Gods and Goddesses.\r\nThe other place that I missed in Amritsar is “Sadda Pind”. It’s a resort which is themed as a Punjabi village. It showcases the day to day lives and activities in a Punjabi village. This place is like a living museum spread over 12 acres of land. There are a lot of shows and activities to keep adults and kids busy throughout the day. It is similar to Chokhi Dhani in Jaipur which showcases Rajasthani culture. The lunch and dinner is included in the ticket price for the day package.\r\nRetreating Ceremony at Wagah Border:\r\nLot of tourists especially Indians like to visit Wagah Border close to Amritsar. As I have already been here, I would like to share my experience. I’ve mentioned earlier in my article that I had visited Amritsar in the year 2006. At that time I was traveling to Amritsar with my dad and driver in our own car. My dad wanted to visit Wagah Border and I had no clue what it was all about. We reached the place and found hundreds of people queued up at the gates. Foreigners are lucky, their queues are shorter and they have a separate entry point. When the gates opened we had to walk for one km amid security checks at various intervals before we reached our seats. The layout of the seats is a little absurd; they look more like stepping platforms and they are lined in such a way that you can hardly see the view on the other side of the border. You will find people rushing and jostling with each other in order to grab the best seats for the view, but here is a fact check ….there is hardly any view. All I could see was the happenings at the Indian side of the border and I had to strain my neck to the left over other peoples’ heads to actually catch a glimpse of the happenings at the Pakistani side.\r\nNow let us come to the ceremony. It involves lowering of the national flags by both India and Pakistan every evening before sunset. It involves a lot of pomp and show and theatrics are added to stir the patriotic fervor in people. First they will start playing loud patriotic Hindi songs and the crowd starts dancing and cheering loudly at the songs. Then you will view some people running towards the border gate with Indian flag in hand. After some time the flag march starts in which the BSF soldiers take several laps to the border gate and back. The body language is over exaggerated, passive aggressive and the legs are thrust upward in such a manner that it almost parallel to the chin. You will view the same behavior of Pakistani rangers if you manage to see the other side of the border. During all this time, a BSF guard was constantly egging us to shout patriotic slogans. He kept on telling us to shout louder, more and more, so much more that we drown out the shouts of the Pakistan residents. I saw the crowd getting whipped up in a shouting frenzy supposedly in their patriotic zeal to outdo the Pakistanis.\r\nTo be honest, I was not impressed with what I saw. It is exactly the kind of jingoism that can be avoided. Unbelievably, the choreographed attempt in a highly charged atmosphere happens daily. With due respect to everybody’s emotions, this chest thumping xenophobia to show Pakistan there place is not really patriotism. You can love your country without deriding the citizens of the other country. I would be much happier if the flag lowering ceremony becomes a quiet affair without any tourists. The aggressive attitude displayed by visitors on both sides of the border does nothing to ease the ages old conflict between both countries.\r\nThere are far more ways to spend your quality time and much better places to visit in Amritsar. This is not one of them. Avoid.\r\nTransportation in Amritsar:\r\nAmritsar has a good access to public transport. It is fairly easy to get a taxi, auto or a cycle rickshaw at any hour of the day. Since it’s a tourist city, the charges can be high and you would need to negotiate every time when you hire an auto or a rickshaw. However, for a single tourist the best way to commute in Amritsar is through Uber Moto or Ola Moto. These are motorcycle cabs in which you are riding pillion behind the rider. Not only are the effective in negotiating the narrow and overcrowded by-lanes of Amritsar but they are safe and quick as well. The best part is that you don’t need to haggle for price and its very cheap; Rs. 15/- up to 3 km and Rs. 25/- up to 5 km. I covered all the tourist spots in the city over two days and paid a princely sum of Rs. 150/- for all the trips. If you are travelling with family then you can consider UBER/OLA cabs but they will not be able to enter the narrow lanes of Amritsar.\r\nConclusion:\r\nAmritsar has definitely grown as a tourist destination by leaps and bounds. It gives a good insight of Punjabi culture and traditions. The Golden Temple and the Partition museum alone are the reasons why one should visit the holy city. Take a chance and explore this place. You will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n');

(10, 'Andaman and Nicobar Islands', 'https://i.pinimg.com/736x/23/48/40/2348408860869f185e7cf95af14522dc.jpg', 'Andaman is a wonder of nature. This archipelago provides a lot of attractions for tourists and backpackers alike. Andaman has some of the best beaches, most virgin natural trails and mesmerising sunsets. The place also has an interesting history and all these reasons were enough for us to plan an Andaman trip.\r\n\r\nWe had always been keener on visiting the mountains. So Andaman, the sea and beaches were quite fresh and lovely for us.\r\nContents [show]\r\nAbout Andaman & Nicobar Island\r\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprises 572 islands that lie at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Out of these 572 islands, only about 38 are inhabited. The Andaman group is separated from the Nicobar group by a 150 km wide channel known as the Ten Degree Channel.\r\nThe Andaman group has 325 islands while the Nicobar group has only 24 islands. North, middle and South Andaman are collectively known as the Great Andaman. The islands include Landfall Island, Interview Island, the Sentinel Islands, Ritchie’s Archipelago, Rutland Island and Little Andaman in the south, which is separated from the Nicobar group of islands by the Ten Degree Channel.\r\nThe main islands of the Nicobar group are Car Nicobar in the North, Camorta, Katchall and Nancowry in the centre and Great Nicobar in the south.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Andaman Island is closer to Myanmar (190 km) and Sumatra (150 km) in Indonesia than it is to mainland India (almost 1200 km).\r\nThe islands are quite unexplored mainly due to the distance and accessibility from the mainland. And that is where the beauty of the place lies.\r\nHistory of Andaman\r\nUsually, before visiting any place, we look at the history of the place. It helps us to understand the place and people better. Andaman trip was no exception. While delving into the history of the place, I did find out some interesting facts.\r\nThat Andaman was a British penal settlement in the colonial era is known to all, but the place seems to have historic evidence older than that period.\r\nIt is not actually known when the first inhabitants came to this group of islands. It is believed that Andaman had a population over 30,000 years ago. The earliest archaeological evidence dates back to 2,200 years ago.\r\nIn between 1014 to 1042 AD, King Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Dynasty was the first one to colonize these islands and formed a naval base to launch expeditions against the Sriwijaya Empire of Indonesia.\r\nLater the islands came under Danish East India Company and were under them till 1868. Finally, these islands were purchased by the British East India Company in 1869 and they later formed a penal settlement in these islands.\r\nTop Places to visit in Andaman Trip\r\nWe realized in our Andaman trip that the place is a delight for both conventional tourists and backpackers alike. The list of places to visit in Andaman is quite a long one, but all these are worth your time. We will start with the conventional places and then go to the offbeat ones.\r\n1. Port Blair\r\nPort Blair is the capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Also the largest town, it is also the entry point for all the other islands. So in all probability your trip will start from here.\r\nThere are a few places of interest in the town like the Cellular Jail, Samudrika Marine Museum, and water sports complex among others. And if you want to visit a beach, you can head towards the Corbyn’s Cove Beach. You can also enjoy water sports here.\r\n\r\nThings to do in Port Blair\r\nVisit the Cellular Jail to see and understand the struggle of the freedom fighters who were sent to this penal settlement for serving punishment. Do not miss the light and sound show in the evening. . It shows the story of the India freedom fighters and how India got independence through the light and sound show.\r\nVisit the Samudrika marine museum, water sports complex to enjoy water sports.\r\nVisit the Corbyn’s Cove to get a vibe of the beach.\r\nDay Trips from Port Blair\r\nThere are a number of day trips that you can do from Port Blair, all of them special in their own. If you have adequate time, you can do all of them, otherwise choose according to your preference.\r\nChidiya Tapu\r\nChidiya Tapu is around 30 km from Port Blair and the place is famous for its sunset and bird watching. You can make a day trip from Port Blair to Chidiya Tapu.\r\nWandoor Beach and Jolly Buoy Island\r\n\r\nThese 2 places can also be covered on a day trip from Port Blair. Jolly Buoy Island is a part of Mahatma Gandhi National Park and the place is famous for its crystal clear water and underwater coral reefs. Boats to Jolly Buoy start at 9 am in the morning from Wandoor and come back by 3 pm. So, if you are planning to take a ride to Jolly Buoy, please reach Wandoor before 9 am.\r\nChatham Saw Mill\r\nSource | Wikimedia\r\nChatham Saw Mill is the oldest and largest sawmill in Asia. But this is not the only reason that you should visit the sawmill. The history of the mill starts from the time when Lt. Archibald Blair landed at Port Blair in 1789 to establish a British settlement there, more so as a deportation centre for the convicts. The sawmill was earlier used to cater to the needs of the west.\r\nMill Timings: 8.00 AM to 2.30 PM except for Mondays and Thursdays.\r\nNorth Bay Island\r\n\r\nTake day trips to North Bay Island and Ross Island. North Bay Island is known for water sports. You can do scuba diving, snorkelling, jet ski, sea walk and speed boat ride here. The island is an hour ferry ride from Port Blair Jetty.\r\n2. Ross Island (Netaji Subhash Chandra Dweep)\r\n\r\nRoss Island is another place that will leave you spellbound. This island was the erstwhile capital of Andaman until 1941 when an earthquake destroyed the island. Ross Island was the headquarters of the Indian Penal Settlement for nearly 80 years.\r\nThe island had markets, bakery, stores, workshop, water distillation plant, church, tennis court, printing press, secretariat, hospital, cemetery, open air theatre and others. Today, everything has disappeared except some old dilapidated buildings, which housed some of these landmarks.\r\nUsually, North Bay Island and Ross Island tour is done together in a day.\r\n3. Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep)\r\n\r\nHavelock Island is the most popular island and also receives the highest footfall of tourists and will be a highlight of your Andaman trip. Havelock boasts of beautiful and pristine beaches, turquoise sea and some of the best diving sites in South Asia.\r\nRadhanagar Beach is considered one of the most beautiful beaches of Asia. You can rent a motorbike or scooty like we did and explore the island. We recommend you to spend at least 2 nights at Havelock Island. Havelock Island is also a backpackers’ delight.\r\nThings to do in Havelock Island\r\nVisit and enjoy a great time on the beautiful beaches of Havelock Island. Visit the Radhanagar Beach during the sunset and Kalapathar beach during the sunrise. Other beaches are Vijaynagar beach and Govindnagar Beach.\r\nGo for scuba diving. As already mentioned Havelock has some of the best diving sites in South Asia. It is better to take a dive from the diving schools that are near Beach no 3 & 4.\r\nLaze around the Elephant Beach. Elephant Beach is about 20 minutes boat ride from Havelock Island. With white sand and beautiful coral reefs, the place is an absolute winner. Also, you can indulge in water sports like snorkelling, sea walk and glass-bottom boat ride here.\r\nYou can also trek to the Elephant Beach from Radhanagar village.\r\nPlanning to visit Havelock Island? Here is a complete Guide to Havelock Island with all the details.\r\n4. Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful island is a backpacker’s paradise. The turquoise blue sea waters and golden sandy beaches are a treat to the eyes. Apart from the pristine beaches, there is also a natural bridge at Neil Island. Shaheed Dweep or Neil Island is a small island and you can explore the entire island in a day on a two-wheeler. Like in Havelock, you can hire a motorbike or scooty here too and explore the island.\r\nA visit to Neil Island or Shaheed Dweep can be done in a day trip, but staying for a night is highly recommended. Neil Island was our favourite place in the entire Andaman trip.\r\nPlaces to visit in Neil Island\r\nVisit the beautiful beaches of Neil – Bharatpur Beach, Sitapur Beach, Laxmanpur Beach and the natural Beach.\r\nAt Bharatpur Beach, you will find a diving centre. You can go scuba diving, glass bottom boat ride and snorkeling here as well.\r\n5. Baratang Island\r\n\r\nBaratang Island is situated between South and Middle Island. It has beautiful beaches, mangrove creeks, limestone caves and mud volcanoes. Baratang Island is about 100 km from Port Blair and it takes almost 5 hours to reach and the conditions of the road are quite poor. We are not discouraging, but visit this place only if you like to explore the unknown and are not intimidated by long hours and poor conditions of the journey.\r\nPlease note that you will need a permit to visit the limestone caves.\r\n6. Diglipur and North Andaman\r\nSource | Wikimedia\r\nThis is perhaps the best-kept secret of Andaman trip. North Andaman is yet an unexplored region of the island. It takes almost 12 hours to reach Diglipur by road from Port Blair. But once you are there, you will be mesmerised by the virgin beauty of the place.\r\nPlaces to visit in Diglipur\r\nRoss and Smith Island\r\nRoss & Smith islands are actually two islands – Ross & Smith joined together by a sand bar to make a single group of islands. The water is crystal clear and the sand bar appears during low tide. During the high tide, the sand bar disappears leaving a trail of water between the two islands.\r\nLamiya Bay Beach: Lamiya Bay beach marks the foothill of the Saddle Peak, the highest peak in North Andaman.\r\nMud Volcano at Shyamnagar & Limestone cave at Diglipur: Like in Baratang, you will see mud volcanoes in Shyamnagar in North Andaman. Limestone caves in Diglipur are also known as Alfred caves and located near Ramnagar Beach.\r\n \r\nAndaman Travel Guide\r\nHow to reach Andaman?\r\nPort Blair is the gateway to Andaman. You can reach Port Blair either by flight or ship.\r\nBy Air: You will get flights to Andaman from all the major cities of India.\r\nBy Ship: If you wish to experience the life at the seas, then you can reach Port Blair by ships that are available from Kolkata, Chennai and Vishakapatnam. It usually takes 4 days to reach Port Blair.\r\nFlights are thus the easiest and convenient option of getting to Andaman.\r\n\r\nIsland Hopping: How to get around on an Andaman Trip?\r\nOnce you are at Andaman, you cannot escape island hopping. There are two types of trips.\r\nIslands for Day Trips\r\nThese islands are nearer to Port Blair and you can make a day trip to these islands. Simply head towards the Aberdeen Jetty and pick up an operator to make your bookings instantly. Your hotels can also do the bookings for you. Ross Island, North Bay Island, Jolly Buoy Islands are some of these islands where you can make a day trip.\r\nIslands for Night Stay\r\nIf you want to visit the Havelock and Neil Island, then you have to go to the Phoenix Bay Jetty. There are Government boats as well as private operators. You cannot pre-book in a government boat. You have to stand in a queue in the morning to book your tickets. Among the private operators, Makruzz is the best.\r\nWe had travelled in both the government ships and Makruzz. Very obviously, Makruzz is faster than the government counterparts, but what I liked in the government ferry is that you can simply roam about everywhere in the ferry and can enjoy on the deck watching the endless blue seas.\r\n\r\nHow to get around within the islands?\r\nYou can hire 2 wheelers at both Havelock and Neil Island to explore the places. Also, you can get cabs if you travelling greater distances. We had hired a scooty at both Havelock and Neil Island to move around.\r\nSome amazing things to do in Andaman\r\nWater Sports in Andaman\r\n\r\nAndaman is heaven for water sports. Bestowed with beautiful coral reefs and clear waters, the archipelago boasts of the best underwater activities. You can go scuba diving, snorkelling and sea walking. For water sports like jet ski ride, banana boat etc, North Bay Island is a good place. You can also do scuba diving and snorkelling here. But we would recommend you to scuba dive either in Havelock Island or Neil Island.\r\nScuba Diving in Andaman\r\n\r\nAndaman has some of the best diving sites in the country and this we have been reiterating for long. Well, it is not without reason, because the beautiful coral reefs and marine life is simply amazing. For Scuba Diving in Andaman, we will recommend Havelock and Neil Island.\r\nIf you are doing scuba at Havelock, don’t do it at Elephant Beach, but do it at the diving sites near Beach No. 3 & 4. There are a number of operators and you can take a pick. We had done with Barefoot Scuba in Andaman. For Scuba diving, don’t forget to take the guidance of certified PADI instructors.\r\nWhere to stay in Andaman?\r\n\r\nAndaman has plenty of options for hotels and in all possible budgets. For your trip to Andaman, we would recommend you to stop for the night at Port Blair and Havelock Island. If time permits, spend one night at Neil Island too. Both Port Blair and Havelock has a lot of options. Diglipur and North Andaman have relatively lesser options. Sio it would not be a bad idea to book beforehand.\r\nCamping at the beaches is not allowed at Andaman unless the resorts arrange it with permission.\r\nWhat to eat in Andaman?\r\nWhile at Andaman, it will be a sin not to try the seafood. At Havelock, you will find some great food at Barefoot Bar and Restaurant, Full Moon Café, Black Beard’s Bistro, Red Snapper and Anju-Coco Resto. Neil Island has very limited options in regards to food.\r\n\r\nIs any permit required for Andaman Trip?\r\nIndian nationals do not require a permit for visit to Andaman.\r\nFor Foreign Nationals\r\nAll foreign nationals required a RAP (Restricted Area Permit) to visit the Andaman Nicobar Islands, which is easily available on arrival at Port Blair by flight or ship from the Immigration Authorities for 30 days subject to availability of valid visa. This is extendable for another 15 days in certain cases with permission and the delegated authority to extend permission is the Superintendent of Police, FRO/CID, Port Blair.\r\nThe Restricted Area Permit can also be obtained from the Indian Missions overseas and also from the Foreigners Registration Offices at New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and from the Immigration Authorities at the Airport of New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.\r\nRecently, to promote tourism in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, foreign tourists will not require RAP for visiting the following 30 Islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands:\r\n(1) East Island (2) North Andaman (3) Smith Island (4) Curfew Island (5) Stewart Island (6) Landfall Island (7) Aves Island (8) Middle Andaman (9) Long Island (10) Strait Island (11) North Passage (12) Baratang (13) South Andaman (14) Havelock Island or Swaraj Dweep (15) Neil Island or Shaheed Dweep (16) Flat Bay (17) North Sentinel Island (18) Little Andaman (19) Chowra (20) Tillang Chong Island (21) Teressa (22) Katchal (23)Nancowry (24) Kamorta (25) Pulomilo (26) Great Nicobar (27) Little Nicobar(28) Narcondum Island (29) Interview Island and (30) Viper Island (Day visit only).\r\nVisiting the tribal areas is strictly forbidden for both Indians and foreigners. So if anyone is trying to sell such Andaman trip, refuse.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to visit Andaman?\r\nAndaman can be visited throughout the year. However, the best season of the island is from mid-November to early March. This is considered to be the best season to visit Andaman.\r\nNetwork and wifi\r\nAlthough you will get mobile services, the data connection at Andaman is very poor. Internet and wifi services are quite bad here. Both Neil and Havelock Islands had very poor mobile network connection also. So enjoy the place without internet and wifi. We were quite happy to spend a few days without these so-called “essentials”.\r\nATMs in Andaman\r\nYou will find a number of ATMs in Port Blair. Havelock too has a few ATMs near Beach No 1 or the Jetty. There are a couple of ATMs in both Neil Island and Diglipur. It is better to carry cash with you while travelling to Neil and Diglipur.\r\n\r\nIs it safe to travel in Andaman?\r\nYes, Andaman is quite safe to travel. The island is quite a peaceful place with not many instances of problems of safety. Of late, the news of the death Christian missionary in North Sentinel Island has been going around. Be aware that a few aboriginal tribes have their home in the remote islands of Andaman & Nicobar and they have kept themselves distant from the civilization. They do not take intrusion in their land and life lightly. So as travellers, we would request you not to visit the tribal areas without a guide. Also, most of the tribal areas are strictly forbidden for both Indians and foreigners.\r\nSecondly, do keep in mind about the safety measures at the sea. Do not go out to swim all alone even if you are a great swimmer. Also please adhere to your instructor or trainer while scuba diving and snorkeling. Stay safe and have a great trip.\r\n\r\nAndaman Trip (FAQs Answered)\r\nHow to reach Andaman by flight?\r\nThe best way to reach Andaman is by flight.

And if you are concerned about the heavy Cherrapunji rainfall, then relax, the locals have survived there for centuries so that you will last a few days at least!!!\r\nIn addition to Cherrapunji there are numerous Romantic places in Northeast as well, so make sure you read the blog until the end as we have listed places that must feature on your Northeast Honeymoon Package.\r\n\r\nImage Source\r\nWhy is Cherrapunji India the wettest place on Earth?\r\n\r\nThe reason for heavy rainfall in Cherrapunji is quite complex to understand, but essentially, it’s the monsoon clouds that form over the Bay of Bengal that flyover relatively flat terrains until they reach Cherrapunji.\r\nHowever, once they reach Cherrapunji, they are faced with the steep slopes of the Khasi Hills and to make their way over them, they first need to dump most of their moisture. As a result of which, Cherrapunji receives heavy and frequent rainfall.\r\nWorld Records Held by Cherrapunji India\r\nCherrapunji, the Wettest place on Earth holds many world records for the highest recorded rainfall in history. But, Cherrapunji Rainfall hasn’t always claimed the number one spot. In the year 1985, a neighbouring town of Mawsynram recorded a staggering rainfall of 26,000 millimetres, beating Cherrapunji at its own game.\r\nThe Indigenous People of Cherrapunji India\r\n\r\nImage Source\r\nThe indigenous people of Cherrapunji are referred to as the Khasi. These Khasi tribes have been lived here for centuries and thrived despite the heavy Cherrapunji Rainfall.\r\nAfter centuries of battling heavy rainfall, the Khasi have developed ingenious ways to turn an otherwise disastrous situation to their advantage. Once such technique is the growing of the living root bridges that take 10-15 years to develop but can last up to several centuries.\r\nThe Famous Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji India\r\n\r\nImage Source\r\nThese century-old bridges made from tangled old roots are not only synonymous with the Wettest place on Earth but are essential for the survivals of the locals.\r\nThe locals use several techniques to ensure that the roots of the trees grow in the desired. The roots are twisted, ties, pulled to merge with the existing bridges and over a period they create natural architectural structure aka Living Root Bridges.\r\nOften scaffolding is made out of perishable material to create temporary structures that are used to train young roots to grow the right way and eventually to replace such structures.\r\nBest Time to visit Cherrapunji\r\n\r\n Planning on booking your Cherrapunji package, make sure you keep in mind the best time to visit.

(12, 'Cherrapunji', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/19/0a/03/24/cherrapunji-is-noted.jpg', 'Cherrapunjee is like an oasis in amongst the states of North East India.\r\nIt’s untouched and therefore It’s full to the brim with gorgeous nature, lush greenery, cascading waterfalls, trekking trails, fresh air and the world-famous Double Decker Living Root Bridges.\r\nYou could spend days or even weeks exploring this natural paradise and you wouldn’t get bored.\r\nIt’s known as the wettest place on Earth or was before a small town nearby trumped them by an inch of rainfall. But, best to visit in winter season (Nov – Feb) to avoid a complete wash out!\r\nMany tourists flock here to explore its green pastures and I was eager to follow in their footsteps.\r\nWhat I experienced here was like none other, the scenery was just so… EPIC.\r\nHere are the 11 reasons why you need to visit Cherrapunjee (known as Sohra to locals).\r\n\r\nHow do I visit Cherrapunjee\r\nCherrapunjee is in the state of Meghalaya on the East side of the Khasi hills and can easily be accessed by a brand spanking new and pot-hole free National Highway 6.\r\nIf you have your own transport you can easily drive here within 3 or so hours from Guwahati, the gateway city to North East India.\r\n\r\nBy public transport, you will need to travel to Shillong first. Unfortunately, there is no direct public transport to Cherrapunjee from Guwahati.\r\nI travelled by sharing car, stayed one night in Shillong and then the next morning I headed off to Cherrapunjee by another sharing car.\r\nIf you’re not familiar with sharing cars or Sumo Jeeps, they’re the public transport here.\r\nYou simply hop in the car or sumo at the stand, wait for it to fill up with passengers and head on out.\r\nDespite them being private vehicles, they’re relatively cheap and it’s rare to be ripped off in North East.\r\n\r\nThis was the sharing car I took from Shillong to Cherrapunjee. Ladies be warned, DO NOT take the last seat aka the one that straddles the gear stick. \r\n\r\nThat thing in the middle is legit a seat!!\r\n\r\nThe taxi aka Shared car rank in Cherrapunjee. These cars will be heading to Dawki, other places in Meghalaya or Shillong.\r\nDo I need a permit to visit Meghalaya?\r\nYou don’t need a permit to enter the state of Meghalaya or report to a police station that you’re visiting.\r\nYou’re free to come and go as you please!\r\nLeaving Cherrapunjee\r\nIt’s good to note that if you were planning on heading to Kaziranga National Park or Guwahati the gateway,  you have to go back the way you came via the National Highway.\r\nYou can travel by the country roads through Meghalaya but it will take you twice or three times as long (not all roads are that good here!).\r\nBest to go back to Guwahati to proceed onto other places in Assam and other states.\r\n\r\nI didn’t make it here but It’s worth checking out Dawki while you’re on this side.\r\nIt’s the closest you’ll get to the bordering country of Bangladesh and has a famous clear water lake.\r\nAgain, if you don’t have your own transport, you can access this by sharing car. Or, hire a private one between you for 3000 rupees. It sounds a lot but between 4/5 of you it’s pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nBudget places to stay in Cherrapunjee\r\nIf you’re backpacking there is an awesome guesthouse called By The Way.\r\nI stayed in a really clean private double room with an outdoor shower and toilet for 500 rupees a night.\r\nThis is a steal compared to the cheapest traveller guesthouse usually costing 2000 rupees!\r\nI believe there is still a hostel-type room open which is 250 rupees per guest per night also.\r\nUnfortunately, this cannot be booked online, no email either but there is a number below you could try. I was just lucky I turned up and there was a room available.\r\nHeprit who owned the guesthouse was such an awesome guy that gave me good information based on my time and budget, a cheap taxi service and endless tips for my journey in North East.\r\nDue to the popularity of Cherrapunjee and especially if you’re travelling in the peak season of winter, expect rocket high prices for this area.\r\nHotels like the Polo Orchid are the luxury resorts to stay in if you have the budget. To check dates and rates click here.\r\n\r\nHere are all the top reasons to visit Cherrapunjee\r\n1. It’s home to the Double Decker Living Root Bridges\r\nThis is probably why most people venture here as these Living Root Bridges are one of a kind in the whole world.\r\nThey’re not actually in Cherrapunjee but a little Khasi village called Nongriat.\r\nI have to say that this place is absolutely stunning but be warned that you will have a bit of a mission getting here.\r\nThe walk is not easy with 3,000 steps in front of you… Each way!\r\nBUT, it’s totally worth it in the long run to see them and the awesome views you’ll come across.\r\nI decided not to stay down here which other travellers thought was insane. To be fair after doing this hike in one day, I have to agree with them. So, this may be an option to consider.\r\nApart from the Living Root Bridges there is Rainbow Falls and tonnes of other pretty scenes to discover down in Nongriat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. You can chase the most amazing waterfalls\r\nI love chasing a waterfall especially when they’re big ones!\r\nWhen you visit Cherrapunjee, you’ll find it’s full of jaw dropping falls but I’d say if you only want to go and visit one than Nohkalikai falls should be it!\r\nNot only will the views surrounding it make your jaw drop, you’ll see the jade blue waters too!\r\nThe entrance to this falls is kind of like an ‘entrance/exit through the gift shop’ but it was cute to see all the local food and souvenirs on sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legend of Nohkalikai falls\r\nThe legend surrounding this was pretty interesting too.\r\nAccording to legend a young lady named Ka Likai had a daughter from a previous marriage and married another man.\r\nHer new husband hated the step daughter. One day Ka Likai returned home and was surprised to see that her husband had prepared dinner.\r\nKa Likai ate the meal without suspicion but later found her daughters fingers in the betel nut basket.\r\nUnable to bear the grief, she threw herself over the cliff. Now the falls are named Nokalikai which means the leap of Ka Likai.\r\nVisiting Nohkalikai falls\r\nEntrance is 30 rupees per person.\r\nMake sure you grab a chai at the cute little shop here. You get a view of the falls from outside too.\r\n\r\n3. It’s untouched with limited population and pollution\r\nWhat I loved about visiting Cherrapunjee in North East India in general was how untouched many parts were.\r\nThere was hardly any cars, traffic or pollution. It was untouched and that made it all the more pleasant.\r\nHere, you’ll find that the air is so fresh and It’s good for your soul. Lap it up!\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The views all around you are outstanding\r\nThe first thing you’ll notice as you enter, even on the drive here, is that the views are jaw-dropping.\r\nIf you have your own means of transport there are many stop off points to take photos.\r\nI’d make use of them because it’s hard to describe what meets the eye.\r\nYou’ll see valleys filled with the greenest trees, cliffs that go on for days, open plains into the neighbouring country of Bangladesh, endless waterfalls, hills, trekking trails and more. You need to leave time to explore.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. You can explore mysterious caves with ancient fossils\r\nAnother thing that Cherrapunjee is famous for are the mysterious caves that have ancient fossils and tunnels.\r\nI personally paid a visit to Arwah Lumsina caves.\r\nNot only did it have amazing views on the walk towards them, but the cave was also huge!\r\nIt cost 25 rupees to enter and a camera fee of 50 rupees. Surprisingly, there’s a 1000 rupee charge for video!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. It’s home to some of the friendliest people\r\nA lot of the locals didn’t like me taking photos as they were super shy but they were so friendly!\r\nI travelled here solo but people were so welcoming. They were curious to know where I was going, where I was from and how long I was planning to stay.\r\nThey loved the fact people visit their side of the world. Make sure you take some time to meet the locals while you’re here. It gives you a different insight.\r\n\r\n\r\nI met these awesome local ladies heading back up the 3,000 stairs from Nongriat. We couldn’t understand each other but that didn’t stop us from smiling and sharing. \r\n7. You can hike in paradise for days\r\nYou may be pleased to know that there are endless hiking trails in Cherrapunjee so you may have a hard time choosing just one!\r\nIf you were planning on staying for just a few days, I would reserve time for the Double Deckers. Then, pick one other place to go.\r\nThere’s never really a ‘set’ trail or path however that maybe the best part about it!\r\nMake sure you take a map. Due to the limited population and phone signal – you don’t want to get stuck!\r\nThere’s a trek to the lesser-known Umkar Root Bridge, the ‘splashing park’, Mawshamok on the Lover’s Road and walks through the village of Laitkynsew for Nongwar village and viewpoints.\r\n\r\n8. It’s near the border of Bangladesh\r\nDid you know that Meghalaya is bordered with Bangladesh? In the peak season of winter, you can see It on a clear day.\r\nIt’s in the distance on the way to the Double-decker root bridges and Dawki.\r\nMake sure you make a stop to have a peek. This may not be so clear if you visit in rainy season though, apparently, you won’t see a thing!\r\n\r\n9. It has some of the bluest waters you’ll ever see in India\r\nIf you want clear water, Meghalaya has many a place.\r\nWhen I was trekking to the root bridges I couldn’t take my eyes off how blue the water was.\r\nIt’s meant to be jade, but it looked blue to me.\r\nIt was like a siren drawing me in and, to be fair, I was so hot I could have dived off the bridge then and there and bathed in it!\r\nYou can also get a natural fish spa at the Double Decker root bridge, again the water is so crystal clear. Locals were swimming in it after the long hike!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. It’s the wettest place on Earth\r\nMaybe not a selling point but the heavy rains are what make this place so lush and green!\r\nWhen I’m in Asia, the one thing I miss is greenery and nature, so I found paradise in Cherrapunjee.\r\nBut it does get amazingly wet throughout the year, so definitely make sure you bring a raincoat! It’s not called the wettest place on Earth for nothing.\r\nOn the flip side, the waterfalls at this time of year are twice as many and look even more dramatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you spot the waterfalls in this picture? There would be 10 times more waterfalls in the rainy season!\r\n11. If there was a heaven on this planet, Cherrapunjee would be it!\r\nWhen you visit Cherrapunjee you’ll find an emerald paradise full of hidden gems.\r\nExplore mysterious caves, majestic waterfalls, unspoilt views, hiking trails with no path and the world-famous Double Decker Living Root Bridges.\r\nIt’s the perfect escape from busy city life and chaos; you can just immerse yourself in nature and breathe in the fresh air.\r\n');

Tirot Singh was the last of the important Syiems of Khasi hills. In 1883, after Tirot Singh, it goes under British authority.\r\n\r\nBritish used to wrongly pronounced the original name of this place Sohra as “Churra”. As a result, this evolved into the current name Cherrapunji in the following British era. You can also visit a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802–31) in the city cemetery. Recently the Meghalaya state government has renamed this place back to its original name, “Sohra“.\r\nCherrapunji is located at 25.30°N 91.70°E. nearly 4,869 feet (1,484 meters) above the sea-level on the summit of the southern ranges of Khasi hills.

(15, 'Coorg', 'https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/COORG.jpg', '                         Coorg and our first travel together\r\nin India, Karnataka, trekking\r\non April 10, 2015\r\n“The most beautiful places are at the end of really bad roads”. Coorg had fit this bill quite correctly back then. With its lure of coffee plantations, exotic homestays and the wild Western ghats, we knew Coorg had to be our honeymoon destination.\r\nWe want to share with you some highlights of our visit to Coorg.\r\nCoorg is synonymous to Indian coffee\r\nWhile talking about Coorg, coffee deserves the first mention. Besides visiting a coffee plantation, we could first hand see the various stages that coffee seeds go through before getting into our cuppa. Carpets of coffee seeds laid to sun dry outside the houses is a common sight in Coorg.\r\nAs are these mountains.\r\n\r\nMany coffee estate owners have opened up their homes to tourists. So one can experience the local life and hospitality of Coorg while staying on a coffee estate.\r\nWhich brings us to the next most exciting part of our visit.\r\nExotic homestays of Coorg\r\nWe travelled through Coorg (officially known as the Kodagu district) from the north to the south. Our stay in the north was in this charming homestay called Windcrest in a tiny village called Galeebidu near Madikeri, the district headquarters. It is home to Girish and Bollu. They spend their winters at Windcrest. The rest of the year, they spend with their daughters’ families in US and UK.\r\n\r\nWe would greet the sun from the gazebo over our outhouse. In between the outhouse and the gazebo was Girish and Bollu’s beautiful bungalow. Our day began with coffee followed by a full-blown breakfast. Followed by the juice of the fruits that Girish grew here in the Windcrest gardens. Dinners were always some delightful local delicacies.\r\nAfter a few days here in northern part of Coorg, we shifted to the south, to a homestay called Spice Garden near Kuta. While the north was all charming like a hill station, the south was raw and rustic. If the north was a well-manicured garden, the south was a wild forest.\r\nQuite fittingly, we stayed in this tent on the grounds of Spice Garden. Tent with a personal porch, dining sit out and a tree house! Spice Garden is home to a modern 21st-century farmer Naveen Cariappa and his entrepreneurial wife Raina (You can call them on +91 9448504061, +91 9448313965. Ask for Raina as she looks into the homestay business.)\r\n\r\nTheir coffee plantations were just next to the homestay. Surrounding these plantations was a beautiful forest.\r\nA passionate wildlife conservationist, who had also participated in the tiger census, conversations with Naveen were as delightful as they were insightful.\r\nThe tent accommodation was a surprisingly relaxing experience. Being in the outdoors, yet warm and cozy with all the privacy one would want, it was a perfect setting.\r\nThe Cariappa family would arrange our candlelit dinners on a dining sit out next to the tent. We feasted on organic home-grown ingredients in fresh local recipes supervised by Raina herself.\r\nPost dinner, we would sit on the porch or by a bonfire, under a blanket of the star-studded sky until it got too cold to be outdoors, then retire to the warm indoor comforts.\r\nThese homestay experiences got us totally hooked on to the idea of staying with the locals, they are now a huge part of our travels.\r\nSome options for homestays in Coorg are the\r\nGreen Pastures Homestay in Somvarpet, an interesting option for a homestay away from the crowds.\r\nIf you want something closer to Madikeri yet tucked away in wilderness, 4 C’s Little Paradise near Madikeri is another homestay option.\r\nHowever, if you still feel that homestays aren’t your cup of tea, there is no dearth of super chic luxury resorts in Coorg.\r\n5-star Evolve Back (formerly Orange County)\r\nTamara\r\nOr the Windflower Resort and Spa, if your budget is somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nWith the stay sorted, you can set out exploring Coorg.\r\nBylakuppe, a little Tibet in South India\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the coffee and forest is a surprising little Tibetan settlement in the form of Bylakuppe. Around 40 km southwards of Madikeri, the Namdroling monastery is located in Bylakuppe. It is built on the land donated to the Tibetian refugees by the Government of India.\r\n\r\nThe main prayer hall in the monastery has a series of such paintings on its walls rendering a very colourful feel to the prayer hall.\r\nIt also houses a religious college. Some monks were studying, preparing for their exams. Except for the maroon robes, it was a scene just like any other university campus!\r\nRich biodiversity of Coorg, thanks to the Western Ghats\r\nThe Western Ghats were added to the UNESCO world heritage list for their rich biodiversity. Being situated on the eastern slopes of these ranges, Coorg is a perfect spot to experience this biodiversity.\r\nEverywhere we went, we could spot a variety of butterflies, birds and reptiles. Going on a nature trail with an expert in this field will be a highly enriching experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highway from Mysore to Coorg passes through the forest. We didn’t have to wait for a wildlife safari to be enthralled by the forest life.\r\nAt one spot, we drove past this wild elephant. Naveen was driving us around and he informed us that this was actually a tuskless male elephant. Female elephants look down upon such males, so he lives a pretty isolated life.\r\n\r\nWe were glad we didn’t disturb this Chital’s early morning yoga routine!\r\n\r\nAnother great place to see the animals up, close and personal is the Dubare Elephant Camp\r\nIf you get your timing right, you can even participate in the bathing and scrubbing of the elephants in the Dubare camp. We got a little late getting to Dubare, so missed out on the elephants. But spent a lovely time by this section of the Cauvery river.\r\n\r\nMeet the tiger at the Nagarhole Wildlife sanctuary\r\nWe didn’t, but many have. We did see the Indian bison, wild hogs, mongoose and the famous Malabar giant squirrel. But the early morning air, and the smell and sounds of the forest – that’s what overwhelms!\r\nSighting or not, it’s a highly recommended experience. Nagarhole has a variety of safaris to suit every budget. The quality also varies accordingly. Whatever the budget, just get into the forest. It’s a feeling words and photos can not do justice to.\r\n\r\nCoorg has several one day/multi day treks for the more outdoor inclined\r\nIts location makes Coorg a perfect starting point for treks in the Western Ghats. From simpler one day treks to the more arduous multi day ones.\r\n\r\nOne trek we went for was in the northern part of Coorg. On a clear day, the waters of the Arabian sea can be seen from the peak here. Our caretaker at Windcrest accompanied us as a guide for this trek. His trivia filled stories about the landscape and the flora-fauna made it a fun outing in the woods.\r\nThe second trek we did was in the southern part of Coorg. This was through the forest where the river Lakshmanteerth originates, near the Iruppu waterfalls. We had to get permission from the forest department for this trek. This time, our guide was a forest guard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trek started off in a bamboo forest, and went through some deciduous and later an evergreen section. Witnessing the rapid changes in the forest was amazing. And sightings of snakes, wild hogs running (escaping a wild elephant, the guide told us) and hairy droppings (indicating a predator’s habitat) was exciting!\r\nAnother popular trek is to the highest peak of Coorg, the Tadiandamol. Moderate levels of fitness and lots of water are a must to finsih this trek comfortably on your own. We didn’t do this trek, but on next visit to Coorg, we definitely will!\r\nTime to spend with nature\r\nEven outside of the mountains or forests, Coorg offers a bountiful of rejuvenating nature time. There are several small islands, perfect for a casual stroll, some canoeing or just a picnic.\r\n\r\nOr walk through farmlands.\r\n\r\nYou know you are in a special place when a walk around town involves sights like these.\r\n\r\nCoorg is not your typical “tourist destination”. It is also a far call from the regular “honeymoon spots”. But if walking through stunning landscapes or under star-studded skies – with just you and that special someone – is your idea of a romantic holiday, by all means, go ahead and plans your honeymoon to Coorg!\r\n\r\n'),

(18, 'Coorg', 'https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/COORG.jpg', '                                          Must visit Coorg\r\n \r\n The native of Kodagu migrated from northern parts of India during the 2nd century. However, the history of Coorg has been formally documented since the late 17th century, when the province was ruled by the Haleri dynasty.\r\nFor the next two hundred years, the dynasty had numerous clashes with the King of Mysore followed with internal family conflicts with power struggle. In April 1834 the state of Coorg was formally annexed by British East India Company. The state remained a part of colonial India till the independence of India in 1947. It became a district of the State of Mysore and later Karnataka.\r\nEnjoy History? Read more of the Grandeur of Mysore Palace with a day itinerary to Mysore\r\n\r\nIllustration of Coorg harvest festival in London News, 1852\r\nWhere Is Madikeri, Coorg?\r\nMadikeri is located in the South-central Karnataka, almost bordering Kerela. It is 250 km from Bangalore and 140 km from both Mysore and Mangalore by road. Madikeri is located on a highland at an altitude of 1,150 meters or 3,773 feet.\r\nBest Time To Visit Coorg\r\nBest time – Winters (October – February): The best time to visit Madikeri or Coorg is in the winter months. The days are pleasant and nights get relatively cold. Temperature can drop to 14°C. The skies are clear and rainfall is not common during this time. Make sure you take an extra layer of clothing with you.\r\nGood time – Monsoon (July – September): I personally enjoy rainfall and the monsoon season in this part of the country is a sight to see. The jungles in Coorg come alive and the forests turn to crazy shades of green. It keeps the temperature in check too. But of course, rainfall may lead you to cancel your outdoor plans. Don’t plan Trekking and adventure sports beforehand in time.\r\nSummer (March-May): It is scorching hot in summer in South India. Although the temperatures are lower than the surrounding cities, the town can get crowded with a lot of tourists. Mid-days are hot and on the worst days, the temperature can go up to 36°C.\r\nFestive Season: Shivarathri is an important festival of the town and also attracts a lot of people from the nearby areas. It is celebrated with a lot of fervor. However, the hotels are full during this time, so get your bookings done well ahead in time.\r\nKaraga is another local festival that welcomes the first rains and harvests with street processions, traditional costumes, and dancing. Dates of the festival may differ with the local calendar.\r\n\r\nView from Mandalpatti Hills on a clear winter day in Coorg\r\nHow To Reach Madikeri, Coorg\r\nCoorg can only be reached by roadways. But if you want to use other transport options, you can break your journey into two legs. Here are the options via public transport:\r\nBus: Ultimately, you will have to reach Madikeri by road since there is no other alternative. The connectivity of the town from nearby cities like Mangalore, Mysore, and Kozhikode are fantastic. Buses from both private operators and government are available.\r\nOvernight sleeper buses also run from Bangalore and takes about 5 hours to complete the journey at night. It may a little more during the day. You can book your bus at redbus.in or abhibus.com.\r\nTrain: While there are railway stations that are closer, Mysore offers the best connectivity. On top of that, you can easily get a bus or a taxi for Madikeri town. A taxi from Mysore to Madikeri would cost between ?2200-2500 and up depending upon the vehicle. You can get one outside the railway station and around 3 hours for the journey.\r\nFlight: Although Mysore has an airport, it has limited connectivity to other cities. A better option is Mangalore airport which is at around the same distance and connects more long-distance flights. You can take a bus from the city or a cab directly from the airport to Madikeri from there. A cab will cost ?2,600 and upwards and takes 3 hours for the journey.\r\nTraveling in Karnataka? Also Check out our blog on How to Explore the Ruins of Hampi\r\n\r\nAerial View of Road to Coorg\r\nHow To Go Around In Coorg\r\nPublic transport is rarely available that connects tourist attractions. You will have to mix up transport options to move around town at affordable costs. Here are some options:\r\nFoot: Madikeri is a relatively small town. If you plan to stay in the center of the city, you can easily walk to most of the tourist attractions on foot. The cool weather makes it an even better experience. For this, it is better if you stay within a 1 km radius of Madikeri Bus station or MG Road.\r\nAuto-Rickshaw: For a single journey, you can find auto-rickshaw like any other town in South-India. However, the rates aren’t fixed. And if they get to know that you are a tourist (which they will if you don’t know the language), drivers tend to overcharge.\r\nYou can also ask rickshaw drivers for a half or full-day tour. They are usually friendly towards tourists. ALWAYS agree on the fare price before you hop on. And if you find yourself in a fix afterward, don’t get too deep in the argument. It will only ruin your day.\r\nDay rental Taxis: If you are traveling with family, in a group, or prefer to travel more comfortably, look at hiring a day cab. It is convenient, you can customize your itinerary, it is also affordable if you split the bill. Sometimes the drivers fulfill the role of a tour guide as well. A day’s rent will range from ?1,800-2,800 from a hatchback to an SUV. You can book a cab with your hotel or online through websites like coorgcabs.com and coorgtours.com.\r\n\r\nPlaces To Visit In Coorg\r\n1. Raja’s Seat\r\nRaja’s seat is probably the most important tourist attraction inside Madikeri town. This place was a favorite amongst the royalty of Coorg who spent the mornings watching the sunset over the surrounding valleys and evening with their queens in the flower gardens. If you are in the town, you can even walk to this place.\r\nThe gardens are maintained flawlessly to date. On the other side is a viewpoint overlooking the green mountains. A number of gazebo entwined with blooming climbers makes it feel so delicate. Just a few hundred meters away is a toy train (they say it is for kids, but you don’t need to believe that). And if you are here till the sunset, there is even a musical fountain show with lights.\r\nRaja’s seat entrance ticket: ?5 per person, ?40 for vehicle parking. The ticket for the toy train costs ?20 per person.\r\nRaja’s seat Park timings: 5.30 am to 8.00 pm every day of the week\r\nMusical fountain timings: 7.00 pm on weekdays, 6.45 and 7.20 pm on weekends.\r\n\r\nView from Raja\'s Seat\r\n\r\nRiding in the toy train in Coorg\r\n2. Abbey Falls\r\nNo hill-station is complete without a couple of waterfalls. The most popular in Coorg are Abbey Falls. They are 8 km outside the main city though, so you need a ride. The falls are gorgeous during the monsoon when waterfed. They are not very impressive in the summers honestly.\r\nAlso, during the peak hours, the place can be jam-packed with tourists looking for space on the hanging bridge just opposite the falls. You need to hike a little to reach the falls. The area around the waterfall is private coffee and spice plantations and the blowing wind sometimes leaves behind a whiff of the aroma.\r\nAbbey Falls timings: 9 am to 5 pm every day of the week\r\nAbbey Falls ticket prices: ?15 per person; up to ?50 for vehicle parking\r\n\r\nAbbey Falls, Coorg\r\n3. Madikeri Fort\r\nMadikeri Fort is one of the last remnants of the Haleri dynasty in Coorg. I will not say that the fort is in the best of its conditions. You can see a considerable amount of degradation.\r\nThe fort was initially built in mud and has been burnt and reconstructed over and over again amidst internal power struggle. It was then built in granite in the late 17th century by Tipu sultan. The fort encompasses a palace inside. It was further reinforced with brick and mortar in the early 19th century. Huge elephant sculptures greet you as you enter the fort. However, the rooms remain vacant and the glamour of the royals has been long lost.\r\nRight next to the parking lot is a church constructed by the British after removing a temple dedicated to Virabhadra. The church is also called the Government Museum. It showcases a collection of articles from the ancient Kodagu settlers. Today, the fort acts as an office of Deputy Commissioner. It is free to enter.\r\nMadikeri Fort Timings: 10 am to 5:30 pm every day of the week\r\n\r\nMadikeri Fort\r\n\r\nInside Madikeri Fort\r\n4. Namdroling Monastery Or Golden Temple, Bylakuppe\r\nNamdroling Monastery should be high up in your list of places to visit in Coorg. The Tibetan monastery is the largest teaching center of the Nyingma lineage (oldest of the four major schools) of Tibetan Buddhism. It is home to thousands of students (both monks and nuns) from the Tibetan community that live and study in these premises.\r\nThe premise where it is built was given by the Indian government to the Tibetan refugees and the foundation of the monastery was laid in 1963.\r\nThe monastery has many buildings and as a tourist, you must take care of not disturbing the monks going about their daily prayers or rituals. The main chamber is gigantic with three huge statues of Tibetan deities in gold color. The walls of the halls depict stories from mythological tales painted in detailed flat colored murals in bright colors. It is amazing to see such a stark contrast in culture in the middle of a Kannadiga town in the Western Ghats. It is free to enter\r\nApart from the main monastery, there is also Tashi Lunpho Monastery nearby which is less crowded. You can walk for 15-20 minutes to reach there. The area around the monastery has a lot of stalls selling souvenirs and restaurants that serve Tibetan food. Don’t miss lunch here.\r\nHow to reach Namdroling Monastery from Madikeri: The closest bus station to the monastery is in Kushalnagar. Frequent local buses from Madikeri run to Kushalnagar. From the bus station, you can take an auto-rickshaw who will drop you directly to the monastery and will charge you around ?50. You can, of course, take a direct cab from Madikeri.\r\nNamdroling Monastery timings: 7 am to 7 pm every day of the week\r\n\r\nNamdroling Monastery, Bylakuppe\r\n\r\nPaintings from Tibertan mythology inside monastery walls\r\n\r\nPrayer Hall Inside Namdroling Monastery\r\nBy the way, it is not considered good manners to face the statue of your Buddha with your back… I didn’t know it, just yet!\r\n5. The Coffee Estates\r\nThe best way to see a close up of the life cycle of a coffee plant is to visit a coffee estate. Even better would be to live there. A number of plantation owners offer homestays in the middle of it. You get up in the morning with the aroma of coffee beans and local spices. However, these tend to be a little outside the city, so choose your transport options.\r\nAnother way is to book a half a day tour with one of the plantations. There are many of them available and you can ask around the locals for their opinions of the best one. Another option is to book a tour with a local travel agency, kind of small counter shops selling out day-tour in Coorg. Here is an article from thrillophilia that chalks out some of the popular plantations in the area.\r\nHow about some Tea? Here is our Travel Guide to Munnar and its tea plantations\r\n\r\nCoffee Plantation in Coorg\r\n6. Omkareshwara Temple\r\nOmkareshwara temple is unique to visit because of its architecture. Despite being a Hindu temple dedicated to ‘Lord Shiva’, the architecture closely resembles a Muslim Dargah. With a spherical dome on top and four minarets, the features are even more accentuated. Inside the main sanctum is the Shiva lingam.\r\nTales tell that it was built in the 18th century by the then king as a way to earn penance. A local Brahmin had fallen victim with his life for the king’s political goals. The king stated that the Brahmin haunted him in his dreams. To quieten his spirit, the king decided to establish a Shiva lingam and construct a temple. It did stop the king’s nightmares eventually.\r\nOmkareshwara temple is within a walking distance from the bus stand. It is free for everyone to enter.\r\nOmkareshwara temple timings: 6:30 am – 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm\r\n\r\nOmkareshwara Temple, Madikeri\r\n7. Dubare Elephant Camp\r\nDubare elephant camp in Coorg is a project undertaken by the forest department. The camp provides food and shelter to retired elephants after they work in the logging business. It is fairly ethical and the elephants are treated well, much like a pet companion.\r\nYou can follow your guide to understand the ecology, biology, and characteristics of elephants. Then you can proceed to scrub one with your own hands at the banks of the Cauvery river. You can also feed them ragi, jaggery, and sugarcane while you are there.\r\nThe option of riding the elephant is also available that is organized twice a day. Rides are arranged from 10 am to 12 noon and 4 pm to 5 pm.\r\nThe camp is around 37 km from Madikeri and you will have to cross the Cauvery river to reach the camp. The queue at the pier is long and tiring. Therefore, try to reach as early in the morning as possible. You can also stay in a room inside the jungle with basic accommodation options. The surrounding forests are full of wild animals that may result in an enthralling and an edgy night.\r\nDubare Elephant Camp Entry timings: The camp is operational between 9.00 am to 5.30 pm. However, the entry time is restricted to 9.00 am – 11.00 am and 4.30 pm – 5.30 pm.\r\nDubare Elephant Camp ticket prices: ?690/1467 for Indian/Foreign travelers for only activities in Elephant camp. ?1330/2270 for Indian/Foreign travelers for full-day activity including Food. ?20 for a boat ride to the camp.\r\nHow to reach Dubare Camp from Madikeri: Dubare Camp is located around 37km outside Madikeri by road. The best way to reach the camp is by cab or an auto-rickshaw and may take more than an hour’s time to travel. No direct buses run to the camp. However, the nearest bus station is Kushalnagar but you need to hire a private vehicle too which may cost ?250 for a one-way trip.\r\n\r\nAn Elephant at Dubare Camp\r\n8. Thadiyandamol Peak\r\nThadiyandamol is the highest peak of Coorg district at an altitude of 1,748 m or 5,735 ft. The start of the trek is at a distance of 41 km from Madikeri. It takes between 3-4 hours to trek one way depending upon your speed and the weather. Rainfall often accompanies but the scenic view is worth it.\r\nYou can either take a group tour from Coorg or even Bangalore for the trek or start on your own. The trek starts from a small village called Kakkabe. Expect to walk around 20 km for a full round trip from the peak. The jungle on the way is full of flora and fauna thick with birds and reptiles. However, trekking is fairly safe and of moderate difficulty. The trail is visible and easy to follow for individual travelers.\r\nLeeches are a common problem during the trek, so you need to wear gear that protects you in this case. Carry a first aid kit, salt, plenty of water to drink, and some food for the trek. Make sure you do not throw plastic wrappers on the way. There is no fee to enter the area. Try not stay in the area after sunset.\r\nHow to reach Thadiyandamol: Take a local bus from Madikeri to Kakkabe and return on the same route. Virajpet, 30 km from Kakkabe also has good bus connectivity from other cities. You can also stay at one of the homestays at the village in Kakkabe for the night.\r\nLove Mountains?

Mandalpatti\r\nMandalpatti mountain is another trekking route near Madikeri just 4 km from Abbey Falls. The route is extremely scenic with aerial views of lush green mountains of the Pushpagiri reserve forest area. While you can ride to most of the park area, you will have to trek the last 3 km or so.\r\nThe jungle is moderately dense and the ride is best experienced on a jeep that costs around ?1500 for a group of 6. There are two routes to visit Mandalpatti. The best option would be to travel via abbey falls with a stopover and return through the Makkanduru route, which is the longer one.\r\nThere is no public transport that travels to this point. Book a private vehicle for the trip. You must carry plenty of water and some food for the trip since there aren’t many stopovers.\r\nMandalpatti ticket price: ?25 per person that you need to buy at the checkpoint. Additional ?45 for vehicle parking.\r\nMandalpatti timings: 6 am to 6 pm every day of the week\r\n\r\nView in Mandalpatti\r\n\r\nTrekking inside Pushpagiri Forests\r\n10.

Raja’s Tomb\r\nIf you have an ample amount of time and are done with most of the other tourist attractions, you can spend a quiet evening at Raja’s Tomb. The tomb is the resting place of the remnants of the Royal Kodagu lineage.\r\nIronically, Lord Shiva has been placed inside the tomb building with a definite resemblance to Muhammadan style architecture since the king was a Hindu devotee. The place is just one kilometer from the bus station and you can easily walk here.\r\nRaja’s tomb timings: 9:30 am to 5:30 pm\r\nRaja’s tomb ticket price: ?2 per person\r\n\r\nRaja\'s Tomb, Madikeri\r\n12.

The sunsets are especially nice and the locals also call it a sunset point. Not many people visit the place. Therefore, you may find it all for yourself. It is free to enter.\r\nThe closest town to the Chiklihole reservoir is Nanjarayapattana. You can take a bus to Madikeri and then take a local auto-rickshaw to reach here. It is also just 10 mins away from Dubare Elephant Camp. So you can make a single trip for both. People also prefer the place for full-day picnic excursions with family.\r\nChiklihole reservoir timings: 8.00 am to 5.00 pm every day of the week\r\n\r\nChiklihole reservoir\r\n13. Irupu Falls\r\nIrupu falls is a freshwater cascading waterfall near Bramhagiri right near the border of Wayanad district, Kerela. It is also near to Nagarhole National Park. Apart from their beauty they are also popularly associated with a legend from a Hindu mythology of Ramayana.\r\nAccording to the tale, Lord Rama was wandering in the forest with his brother Laxamana searching for his wife Sita. During the search, Rama got thirsty and asked his brother to fetch him some water. Laxmana shot an arrow into Bramhagiri hills and a river Laxmana Tirtha appeared. This goes on to be a tributary of the Cauvery river.\r\nA famous Shiva temple nearby attracts a lot of pilgrims during Shivaratri. There is no public transport to this place and you will have to arrange a private vehicle to reach here.\r\nIrupu Falls ticket price: ?50 per person\r\nIrupu Falls timings: 6 am to 6 pm open on all days of the week\r\n\r\nIrupu Waterfalls near Bramhagiri, Coorg\r\n14. Adventure Sports In Coorg\r\nCoorg is also a go-to place for adventure activities. White River Rafting is available near the Dubare Elephant camp for a stretch of 2.8 km. The rapids range from levels 1 to 4. However, seasonality is really important. Rafting is usually not available if the water levels in the river are too low.\r\nKayaking and canoeing are available with Jungle Mount Adventures on the calm waters of Kaveri. Coorg flying adventures provide facilities for microflying in the area, an exhilarating aerial ride ranging from 10 to 30 minutes.\r\nZiplining, Camping and trekking are other activities in Coorg that adrenaline seekers and nature lovers opt for. But it is far better to take assistance and contact travel guides for the ones you are not aware about. Thrilliophilia.com offers the best packages for Coorg at a reasonable price. However, most of these activities are done in a group, so check beforehand.\r\n\r\nRiver Rafting in Coorg\r\nWhere To Stay In Coorg\r\nThere is a large range of stay options that you can get in Coorg depending upon your preference. From Jungle lodges inside National Parks, Camping in forests, Homestays in the middle of spice gardens and coffee plantations, budget hotels in the heart of the city to luxury resorts, there is everything in Coorg.\r\nA budget room in the city will average around ?1,000 a day with basic amenities. I personally use agoda.com to book hotel stays since they give deep discounts on almost all hotel properties. However, you can also use booking.com, makemytrip.com or yatra.com for booking.\r\nHomestays in coffee plantations will also cost you an average of ?1,500 a day and can go up to ?10,000 for better facilities. Jungle lodges tend to cost on the higher side starting from ?4,500 for a night for a room. Hostels and dorms are almost absent in Coorg.\r\nHomestay: Creekside Cabin, Sabaoth Stays, The Road’s End, Honey Pot Homes\r\nFarm Stay: Holidayincoorg Nature’s craft estate stay, Heights Farm Stay, Kwality Estate, Eco Habitat\r\n\r\nTraditional Coorgi homes in Madikeri\r\nWhat To Eat In Coorg\r\nWith so many fresh spice gardens around Coorg, I don’t need to emphasize, how awesome Coorgi food is. You don’t really need to beat your head over it. You can enter directly inside one of the many small restaurants and order something from their never-ending long menu. To top it off, do not forget your filter coffee at the end.\r\nThe breakfasts are something to see. A lot of dishes are made out of rice – both sweet and salty. So if you hang around the market early in the morning, you may find something different on the menu.  talking about some of the popular dishes in Coorg.\r\nDon’t forget to grab a fruit wine. There are a lot of wine shops around the town that sells fruit wines made out of fruits like pineapple, gooseberries, grapes, apples, and everything you can think of. Most of them are home-made by the locals. Found it delicious.\r\n\r\n');

It is known for its tranquility, coffee plantations, and rich culture. In Coorg, you can enjoy the scenic beauty of Western Ghats all through the journey. Roads in Coorg are surrounded by coffee plantations and pepper vines. It will be hard to take your eyes off the roads itself. All the big coffee players in the market have their plantations in Coorg including Tata Coffee which operates the world-famous Starbucks in India. Now you know where Starbucks coffee beans are sourced from in India.\r\nBest Time to Visit Coorg\r\nCoorg has tropical weather which remains pleasant throughout the year. Monsoons are a little fierce hence people should avoid visiting between the months of June to September. But if you’re looking for a leisure trip then you can just book a homestay amid the coffee plantation and enjoy the spectacular views of the valley during the monsoon.\r\nThe apt time to visit Coorg is between October to Feb, when you can enjoy the sightseeing as well as outdoor activities.   \r\nHow to Reach Coorg\r\nCoorg is approximately 270 KM from Bangalore, 150 KM from Mangalore and 118 KM from Mysore. It takes 5-6 hours from Bangalore and approx. 3 hours from Mysore & Mangalore to reach Coorg by Road. There is no direct connectivity through train or flight. \r\nCoorg by Road\r\nThe most common and easiest way to reach Coorg is by Bus. Bus services are available from all major cities in Karnataka including capital city Bangalore, Mangalore & Mysore. Frequency of buses higher from Bangalore. Government and as well as private bus services are available. You can book through the KSRTC official website or Redbus.com. Please check the type of bus before booking, if images are not available on KSRTC try to google the same. The best option at cheaper cost would Airavat Club Class buses at 8 USD which you can book through the KSRTC website.\r\nApart from buses, you can also hire your own cab for 3 days which will cost you around 170 USD depending on the type of cab. If you’re traveling in a group, I would recommend you take this option as it will ease your commutation in and around Coorg as well. \r\nThere are many online travel agencies like Make my Trip, Yatra.com where you can easily book a cab. \r\nCoorg by Train\r\nThere is no railway station in Coorg, the nearest one is in Mysore and Mangalore. So, you can reach the nearest railway station and then hop on the bus to Coorg. Mysore has more frequent buses to Coorg than Mangalore so it will be a better option. Plus, even if you have to wait for your bus in Mysore you can explore this little town as well. \r\nCoorg by Air\r\nAgain, the nearest airports are Bangalore and Mangalore International Airports. Mysore also has a domestic airport but there are limited flights. Just remember you can catch the direct bus (FlyBus) till Mysore from the Bangalore Airport itself. Therefore, you don’t need to enter the Bangalore City which will save a lot of time for you. Cab services are also available, but the bus is a better and cheaper alternative. The same services are available at Mangalore International Airport as well.\r\n\r\nWhere to Stay in Coorg\r\nThere is a vast number of options available in Coorg from luxury cottages to beautiful homestays to budget hostels. Zostel and Manyana Hostels are one of the best options for budget accommodations. With prices as cheap as 7-8 USD per night for dorms, both hostels have a spectacular location and delicious food. \r\nZostel is located amidst coffee plantation, waking up in the morning would never be this much refreshing. There is a pond nearby the property, stroll around and breathe in the fresh air away from city chaos. \r\nAvoid taking accommodation in the center of Madikeri Town and near the bus stop. Such hotels are usually expensive and are in the overcrowded streets. You will always find better options a little away from the main town. Find the right accommodation online if you don’t want to risk overspending. The map below can help you out with that as well.\r\nAbout this 3-day Coorg Itinerary\r\nCoorg has so many places in and around where you would love to spend time. But due to promoted tourism, there’s an increase in the number of tourists visiting Coorg and hence most of the places remain overcrowded. In this Coorg itinerary, I would mention the top places that are worthy of your time and effort. Also, how you can avoid the rush of tourists just by planning your day in advance. And then you can easily plan your own itinerary for Coorg based on your comfort and ease. \r\nDay 1 \r\nDubare Elephant Camp\r\nThis camp has been started when woodcutting and logging operations were banned by the Government. There are around 100 elephants in the camp, and they are now being taken care of by people hired by the Government. Dubare Elephant Camp is a perfect place to experience the life of elephants. Here you can spend time with elephants, can feed them, get down in the river Cauvery to watch elephants taking bathe in the river (They charge 2 USD per person to get into the river with elephants).\r\nElephants Enjoying Shower Time with their Caretakers at Dubare Elephant Camp.\r\nThe camp is situated next to Cauvery River and you’re supposed to take a boat to cross the river. It opens at 9 AM and gets closed at 11:30 AM, you have to stand in the queue and wait for your turn to take a ferry ride to the camp. The cost of the ticket is 1 USD per person. It is advised to reach the camp by 8:30 AM as the queue gets longer later. If you reach the camp early, it will also mean that you can enjoy more before the tourists’ rush comes in. \r\nAlso, just be a little responsible and gentle while playing with elephants. These animals are forced to live in camps, although the camp area is huge but doesn’t match with the natural habitat and freedom of elephants. Your kind behavior can help them to feel a lot better.\r\nNamdroling Monastery\r\nCoorg has rich cultures, apart from the local cultures they give equal respect to foreign culture as well. There’s a town called Bylakuppe (5KM from Kushalnagar and 35 KM from the main town of Madikeri), a hub for Tibetans. And here you’ll find the famous Namdroling Monastery, also known as The Golden Temple. Bylakuppe is the largest settlement of Tibetans in India after Dharmashala and the largest teaching center of Nyingmapa, a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. This Monastery is also home for around 6000 monks who’re peacefully living here. \r\nNamdroling Monastery is an excellent example of Tibetan architecture. It is spread over an area of 80 sqm and has 40 feet high statues of Guru Padmasambhava, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Amitayus. The main shrine is in a huge hall where hundreds of monks pray together. Walls of the hall are covered with beautiful paintings and murals from Tibetan & Buddhist mythology. I meditated for a while sitting inside and trust me it helped me to cleanse my entire aura. \r\nBeautiful Interiors of Famous Namdroling Monastery, Bylakuppe.\r\nTake a stroll around the Monastery and get ready to explore the market and food joints nearby. \r\nTibetan Market for Food & Shopping\r\nJust outside the Namdroling Monastery, there is a shopping complex and a lot of cafes where you can hog on Tibetan food. In fact, inside the Monastery premises as well there are cafes and shops. Interestingly, all the money collected through monastic enterprises- shops, guest houses, and cafés thereafter go towards the welfare of monks living in the monastery.\r\nBut the shops outside have better prices for the same things that you will buy within the premises. And if you decide to explore more in Bylakuppe there are many other markets where you can find cheaper deals. As Namdroling Monastery is the most famous landmark in Bylakkupe, prices are a little higher. You can pick up prayer flags, prayer wheels, dreamcatchers from the shops. Many souvenirs are also available, take few as a token of memory from this beautiful place.\r\nCafes in Bylakuppe\r\nNamling café inside the monastery premises is really nice, we had ordered a lot of food and beverages. Ginger Lemon Tea, Vanilla Frappe and veg burgers were the best. This café has the cutest ambiance. Just sit back and enjoy the surroundings. With so many monks around you, this place seems to be another world. \r\nApart from Food, Namling Cafe had the Cutest Decor too.\r\nThere are many other eateries where you can enjoy authentic Thukpa and Momos (momos are classic dumplings stuffed with ingredients of your choice and are now very popular street food in India). At a distance of 4 KM from the Monastery is Potala Kitchen, one of the famous restaurants in the Tibetan region here. I tried varieties of dumplings here and left with satisfied taste buds. Just you to know this place had a long menu of 7 pages with Bhutanese, Tibetan and Indian dishes. Sadly, I was not aware of many of the dishes and hence decided to binge eat Momos only. \r\nAlso, you will love the fact that there are only a few tourists and most of the people are wrapped around in red and mustard robes, the monks. \r\nChiklihole Reservoir for Sunset\r\nAfter spending time at Bylakuppe, move on to Chiklihole Reservoir for witnessing the sunset. It’s a 30 minutes’ drive from Namdroling Monastery. This reservoir was so beautiful, and the view of the sunset was even more. It is advisable to check the sunset time on google and reach the dam 15 minutes prior to capture the pictures or maybe for a stunning time-lapse. \r\nChkilihole Reservoir is a Wonderful Sunset Point.\r\nThe clouds, colors of sky and sun, all had their reflection in the water of the reservoir as if someone just painted a replica of the sky in the water. What a view it was!!! \r\nDay 2\r\nTrekking- Tadiandamol & Mandalpatti\r\nCoorg houses few of the Karnataka’s highest peaks. The scenic beauty of Coorg makes trekking a good idea. And if you were already smitten by encounters on day 1 then I must tell you much more is waiting for you. Mandalpatti and Tadiandamol are two of the best options. Tadiandamol is Karnatak’s 3rd highest peak, standing 1748 meters high, and is very popular among the trekkers.\r\nFor Tadiandamol you have to trek although the peak whereas in Mandalpatti you can choose to take jeep as well to reach the peak. Both the places have their own charm, and good weather is just cherry on the top. \r\nTadiandamol Trek\r\nThis trek is 12 KM long, to and fro distance from the base point. Trek starts at the base of the hill at Nalkanad Palace. The terrains are quite steep right from the beginning so brace yourself to take on the challenge. I would recommend starting the trek between 8:30 AM & 9 AM since it is a popular trekking point people will start pouring in and you would miss the tranquility at the top. Make sure that you have a healthy power breakfast before you start. Carry a travel water bottle, a lot of snickers and other quick bites to keep yourself charged.\r\nI had started at 9:30 AM, reached the peak at 12:15 PM and started descending at 1 PM and reached back at the base point at 4:20 PM.\r\nWeather changes drastically during the trek, at one point it will be raining while at others it will get all sunny. Do carry your sunglasses, raincoat and a cap to cover yourself as per the weather conditions. Pack light in a small backpack, it will be difficult to climb otherwise.\r\nAfter covering some 3KM you would reach the Shola Forest checkpoint. They charge 2 USD per person as a fee to enter the forest area.\r\nView from the Peak of Tadiandamol.\r\nWell after you enter the forest area, the trek gets a little difficult. I have usually seen treks that require ascending and descending both but at Tadiandamol you majorly have to ascend only. Nonetheless, view compensate for all the pain. After reaching the top you will clearly see yourself walking through the clouds.\r\nThere would be mist, clouds and breathtaking views of the hills surrounded by Shola forest.\r\nMandalpatti\r\nMandalpatti is a must-visit place near Coorg. This place is called Mugilu-Pete in the local language which means the Market of Clouds. And Mandalpatti is actually a place where you will find yourself surrounded by big cotton clouds. It is indeed a hidden gem of Karnatka with lush green surroundings and majestic views from the hilltop.  The best part about Mandalpatti is it is not commercialized yet which makes it a perfect place to cut loose from city chaos.\r\nLocated 20 KM from the main town of Madikeri, you can cover 17 KM by vehicle, but the last 3 KM has to be covered either by trekking to the top or by jeeps of the forest department. One jeep will carry 5-6 people, although with my personal experience I would suggest trekking to the top. As you ascend to the top views will leave you astounded. You will need approx. 5-6 hours to cover Mandalpatti\r\nPlease note that there are no shops & food joints nearby Mandalpatti hence carry all the necessary things with you. You can have a little picnic on the hilltop but ensure that you don’t litter around. Also during monsoons, the terrain gets really muddy and it is not advisable to visit here.\r\nI highly recommend adding Mandalpatti in your Coorg Itinerary.\r\nDay 3\r\nThe last day of the itinerary can be kept more of a leisure type and you can explore the main town and market of Madikeri. There are many tourist places within the main town, but I’ll tell you the places that are worth visiting despite being too crowded. \r\nOmkareshwar Temple\r\nOmkarhswar temple is dedicated to Lord of Shiva of Hindu mythology. It is famous for its Gothic and Islamic mix of architecture. Temple is situated in the center of the main town. Try to reach early in the morning by 8 AM to enjoy the serenity around the temple. There’s pond just outside the temple where people can to feed the fishes. Spend some time reading the architecture of the temple and just soaking yourself up in the aura. Please note you might not be allowed to click pictures inside the temple.\r\nThe Pond outside Omkareshwar Temple with a Shrine in the middle.\r\nTalacauvery\r\nFrom Omkareshwar Temple head towards Talacauvery, which is the origin point of river Cauvery. On the way to Talacauvery have breakfast at South Indian restaurant, there are many of them. It will take around an hour to Talacauvery. On reaching Talacauvery you will find a huge arch at the gate amidst the Brahmagiri hills. Talacauvery is famous for two things, firstly for the temple dedicated to Kaveriamma (Mother Cauvery, yes in India people worship all the rivers) and secondly for the majestic views of the Brahmagiri hills.\r\nView of Brahamagiri Hills from the Top of Talacauvery.\r\nTemple premises are huge with a pond and the Cauvery is said to be flown through it after originating from the hills. Behind the main shrine, the building is the staircase which leads to a viewpoint. You have to climb around 400 steps before you can get a panoramic view of the Brahamagiri Hills. The view is just so surreal and peaceful, I believe places near temples have an aura that calms you down and makes you feel alive.  Sit back and relax, click some good pictures and head to your next destination. \r\nCoffee Plantation Visit\r\nIf you’re in Coorg, then your visit is incomplete without visiting Coffee Plantation. There are many coffee estates in and around Madikeri Town where you can visit the plantation and learn about the process of coffee making. Tour lasts for at least an hour. Although you can such visits online, I would suggest you inquire local people about the same. They will advise you on the best ones at cheaper charges than what you will find online. Also, by doing so you don’t need to worry about the timings and can plan according to your own convenience. \r\nCoffee Plantation in Coorg.\r\nGetting Around Coorg\r\nWell, Coorg doesn’t have any subways and metro trains so people either take private cabs or public road transport. Local buses and auto-rickshaws are readily available from the main town of Madikeri. Although you might have to wait longer for local buses as the frequency is not very consistent. But remember if you’re traveling to offbeat places like Chiklihole Dam you have to book auto rickshaw as conveyance will not be available.\r\nAlso, private cabs are available in Coorg which will charge around 21-25 USD per day. The plus point is you can save a lot of time which otherwise will be wasted in waiting for a local bus or negotiating with an auto-rickshaw driver. \r\nIf you’re traveling in a group, I would highly recommend booking the cab from Bangalore city itself. Usually, a 4-seater cab will charge 0.5 USD per KM plus 4.2 USD per day for the driver (this does not include any toll charges). For a three-day trip, it will cost around 170 USD including everything- fuel, driver charges, and road toll fees.\r\nSo next time when you’re in South India don’t forget to visit Coorg and now that you have a comprehensive Coorg itinerary you will see and do just the best things.\r\n\r\n'),

These days a walk for about 5-6 minutes is required from the main gate along a narrow road that first goes downhill and then uphill. You will notice a few small houses on the right with prayer flags fluttering in front of them on the way. You will reach another gate, as you walk along, and some flights of stairs that lead to the Japanese Temple.\r\nThere is a picture of the founder Fujii Guruji, as you enter the temple. It’s a Buddhist religious temple, hence there is also a model of Buddha. “Nipponzan Myohoji” was started by Fujii Guruji. Fujii Guruji was also a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi apart from being the founder and preceptor of “Nipponzan Myohoji.” He had seen the tragedy of the atom bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will reach the large prayer room upstairs, as you walk up the wooden stairs. From 4:30 am to 6:00 am in the morning and again from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm in the evening are the prayer timings. You can join the prayers and get an opportunity for introspection and feel the divine peace the temple offers. If you can time it right, you will see the present Guruji or the chief priest offering the prayers. In the prayer room, a huge drum is beaten (also known as Ho-ko) from which a reverberating sound originates and fills the entire temple premises. What adds to the solemn atmosphere is the humming sound and the chants.\r\nYou will be invited to sit and join the prayer, as you enter the room. You too can drum in the same rhythm, hence a small drumming pad and a stick will be given to you for the same. You will be amazed how such a small pad too can generate similar resonating sound. You will be offered small sweet balls on your exit that represent the deity’s blessings. Inside the temple, photography is allowed but at the same time, it is prohibited in the prayer room when the prayer is going on.\r\nAlso Read: Baba Mandir, Sikkim -Must Visit During your Darjeeling Vacation\r\nThe Peace Pagoda is close to the temple some 100 yards away. On November 3, 1972, the foundation stone of the Peace Pagoda was laid by Nichidatsu Fujii and on November 1, 1992, it was subsequently opened. The appearance of the Peace Pagoda is a depiction of Lord Buddha radiating peace and non-violence. According to the Lotus Sutra, it purifies the land as well as the mind and soul of the people. In Kumamoto, Japan, the first Peace Pagoda was built by Fujii Guruji in the year 1954.\r\nFour avatars of Buddha are showcased by the Peace Pagoda. This is the tallest free-standing structure in Darjeeling. Its height is 28.5 meters and diameter is 23 meters. You will see two concrete models of lions on two sides at a lower level,  as you climb up the stairs in the Pagoda. All large statues of the avatars of Buddha are carved in the walls and polished in gold colour. Dr M. Ohka of Japan designed The Peace Pagoda which took three years to construct. \r\n\r\nAt the pinnacle, take a walk (‘Parikrama’) around the pagoda. You can witness beautiful artwork etched on sandstones that look like a wooden framework depicting the life of Buddha and his relics. During the Parikrama, one will see the four avatars of Buddha that includes Buddha’s postures such as sitting, sleeping, standing and meditating. You get wonderful views, from the top of the pagoda and also see the Japanese Temple at a distance. Behind that there are rows of pine trees. As you look around to the left, you will see the mountain range. The snow peaks are clearly visible from here on a clear day.\r\nSuggested Read: Batasia Loop, A Must- Visit During your Darjeeling Vacation\r\nOpening Hours of Japanese temple and Peace Pagoda\r\nThe opening hours of the temple are from 4:30 am in the morning up to 7:00 pm daily.

My hand on the dashboard was the only thing that was saving my face from hitting the windshield. I was wearing seat belt, but I somehow had lesser confidence in them than my triceps. Up until that day I felt that 5 months of gym had made my arms rock hard. But this one downhill drive had debunked my myth completely.\r\nThis wasn’t my first trip to Darjeeling, I had been on these roads before. But this time around the road felt steeper and curves more aggressive. May be it was the driver who was for some reason un a hurry. Mountain roads are steep, but this road in particular should not be even called a road. It was a roller coaster masquerading as a road. My triceps were burning now, I was wishing for this drive to end quickly, but from my earlier experience I knew that the Rock Garden was still some distance away.  \r\n\r\nTable of Contents:\r\nThe Barbotey Rock Garden – A Brief History.\r\nThe Entry\r\nThe Trek\r\nThe Barbotey Rock Garden – A brief history:\r\nWe were heading towards our last stop for the day, the Rock Garden of Darjeeling. It’s full name is Barbotey Rock Garden, and was created by the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC, now known as GTA). It was created so that the visitors have an added incentive to come to the hill station. After all tourism has been one of the main sources of earnings for Darjeeling.\r\nThe roads leading up to the rock garden were laced with Tea estates all around. It was one of the most scenic roads in our trip till then.\r\nSo after oscillating between feeling of ecstasy, generated from the prettiest mountains and the adrenaline that the hairpin bends gave us, we finally turned a corner from where I could hear a faint sound of water splashing on rocks. I have had my fair share of waterfalls to know that we were nearing the coveted Rock Garden and the sound was from the mighty waterfall.\r\nSoon we could see the sliver of water cascading down from the rocks and groups of frantic tourists taking turns in front of the fall for that one good picture.\r\nThe first view of the Rock Garden from the road on the opposite side\r\nThe Entry:\r\nThe entry of the rock garden is laced with multiple makeshift stalls vending everything touristy. Shops ranging from food to souvenirs have found a strong footing here. There are even a couple of Car Wash shops as well. You read it right, Car Wash. It is worth noting that Darjeeling suffers an acute shortage of water, so water is conserved and spent only on essentials. So when someone comes to this part of the town, they utilize the free and abundant water to wash their cars. Some enterprising enterprenure must have come up with the idea of monetizing the whole affair.\r\nIt was the month of December, and it gets dark very quickly, therefore we had decided to have our lunch at the rock garden itself thereby saving some daylight for our tour. We were not in the mood of a typical lunch and hence decided to go light. So, we braced ourselves in one of the shacks and ordered momos, omlets and magii to our hearts content. Soon our food was in our stomachs and we were ready to explore the place that was promised as the highlight of our trip to Darjeeling.\r\nThe Trek:\r\nDon’t be fooled by the name, this is not a garden made of rocks. It is more like smaller gardens nestled inside rocks. Basically the whole areas have been created by cutting and arranging rocks around a natural waterfall. It has been terraced to form a multilevel picnic ground with seating arrangements at various level. Each level provides a up close and personal view of the waterfall that comes all the way from the top and over the rocks to down below.\r\nThere are plenty of seating arrangements on all the levels. These seats are placed strategically so as to provide a backdrop of the waterfall. These seats are more sought after for the stunning photos that one can have rather than serving as seating areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\nWe started our assent towards the top of the garden. We kept climbing stairs, go up ramps and cross small bridges across the rocks to reach up to the top.\r\nThere were many flowering plants around, I since it was winter they bore some beautiful flowers. I was so happy to have come in the winters.\r\n\r\nWe kind of thought that we will make our way to the top of the mountain and check out the source of the waterfall. So we started climbing up the stairs and narrow pathways careful enough to place more weight on the side of the path that was towards the mountain and not on the railing. We were climbing at a relentless pace and stopped only for photographs. One can’t really be blamed when the surrounding is so beautiful.\r\n\r\nSo after clicking a million photographs we reached the top, or should I rather say the most high the pathway reached. Unfortunately the path doesn’t lead to the top but rather turns around midway and drops you off at the starting point. So basicaly you get a panaromic view of the small hill that forms the rock garden.\r\nThat however didn’t leave me unsatisfied. It was one very peasant trek which provided for some views those were unparalleled. I believe this might not the best thing Darjeeling has to offer, the sun rise at Tiger hill still tops my list of best Things to do at Darjeeling. The hill town is full of nature’s bounty and the Rock garden might just be the cherry on top of a very pleasing dish served with lots of love.\r\n\r\n'),

Visit the Hill, right before the time of Sunrise, the sight will be just adorable. As the sun slowly rises up from the horizon, the sky becomes vibrantly coloured illuminating the peaks. Get lost in the sight at the Tiger Hill, which cannot be comprehended in words. Although the event lasts only for a few minutes, it will be the favourite memory, a memory of a lifetime. Stand facing the eastern side and wait for the clouds to get brighter and brighter. The Sky changes its colours from purple to pink to orange. As the sun rises from the mist-clad hills, the peaks of Kanchenjunga and Everest glimmers happily. The bright ball of fire slowly emerges through the hill, and tourists will cheer aloud, ‘A very Good Morning’ \r\nThe beautiful sunrise will keep the whole day warm. Discover this beautiful moment at the Tiger Hill by having your loved one near you. You should consider visiting Darjeeling in 2020, as the town is ready to welcome tourists from July 1. Being the most favourite Hillstation closest to the city of Kolkata, the town is the best option for a weekend getaway. When you are in the quaint little town of Darjeeling, down the Himalayan foothills, ensure that you don’t miss the rise of the sun at Tiger Hill.\r\n\r\nLocation and Accessibility\r\nThe Tiger Hill is located 11 km away from the Darjeeling town, in the state of West Bengal. It lies at an altitude of 2590 metres offering breathtaking views of the sunrise. From the town, it takes at least one hour to reach the Hill. The Hill has a panoramic view of Kanchenjunga and Mount Everest, which makes the visit so special. You can also spot local men and women selling hot cups of coffee/tea and you can grab a drink on the way. The snow-capped peaks of Kanchenjunga with the illumination by the rays of the sun is just a heart-warming sight to see! The sun paints the sky in different colours, like in fairy-tale!\r\nSince only a one-way road connects to the hill, you can expect traffic all the time. Being a popular tourist attraction, several vehicles line up on the road, there can be a delay in parking as well. The easiest way to reach the attraction is to take a cab. The cab driver parks the car below the top and you can walk uphill to save time.\r\n\r\nPerks of arriving early at the Hill\r\n Get the prime spot\r\nBeing a very popular attraction in Darjeeling, the Tiger Hill pulls a lot of tourists in the morning. So, get the bonus point by arriving early to the spot, between 03:15 and 03:30. You’ll get enough time to climb up till the summit and keep your cameras, binoculars ready, wait for the ethereal moment.\r\n Park your car safe\r\nIf it is a great season in Darjeeling with a high number of tourists, ensure that you start early to the Tiger Hill. Because several cabs will queue up on the road, below the top. This makes parking really difficult. Arriving early at the spot, let’s you park your car at the safe place and walk uphill. Hence, the best option is to hire a cab, because the driver takes care of the parking while you climb uphill.\r\n Enjoy the scenic views\r\nThey say, ‘The journey is more important than the destination’ and yes, the drive towards the Tiger hill is so breathtaking. Simply, you get to enjoy the drive as the roads get steep and narrow, surprising you every minute. From the narrow Hill Cart road to the steep Senchal road, the ride will be amazing. As you move towards the mist-clad hill, you will see the lovely meadow. Enjoy all this only by starting early because, if you are late, you know the consequences.\r\n\r\nVisitor Information\r\nThe Tiger Hill remains open from early morning till sunset. You can buy tickets directly at the site. The authorities at the entrance issue tickets based on the levels you choose to view the sunrise. There are chairs available in the Observatory tower. The Ticket price depends on the comfort level you choose in the tower.\r\n\r\nFrom the Darjeeling city centre, there are several cabs, jeeps available for drop and pickup. There are private cabs and shared cabs options to choose from. Ensure that you reserve a cab the previous night itself and go easy in the morning.\r\nBest time to visit the Tiger Hill\r\nSince this celestial event is totally nature-based, a ‘best time’ to visit is not predictable. But when you plan a vacation to Darjeeling, ensure that you don’t plan it at the time of Monsoon. In the Monsoon months (mid-June to end September) rains are expected and hence the possibility to spot the sun at its best is not guaranteed. Even during peak winters, mist and fog can block the view. Clear sky promises a fantastic view of the sunrise. Hence, choose October to May to plan a fantastic vacation to Darjeeling.\r\n\r\n'),

Later, Rabdentse was declared the capital from 1670 to 1814 and then Tumlong was the capital between 1814 and 1894. Finally, King Thutob Namgyal transferred the capital of Sikkim to Gangtok in 1894 and it became the centre of royal administration in the kingdom of Sikkim.\r\nMuch later in 1975, Sikkim joined India as its 22nd state and Gangtok became the capital of Sikkim.

Rumtek Monastery\r\n\r\nLocated about 23 km from the main city, Rumtek Monastery is the most famous monastery in Gangtok and must be on your list of places to visit in Gangtok.\r\nRumtek monastery is one of the largest in Sikkim and belongs to the Kagyu sect that originated in the 12th century in Tibet. The architecture of the monastery is one of the finest in the world and resembles the original one in Tsurphu, Tibet.\r\nSituated on a hill-top, you can see an amazing view of Gangtok town from the monastery.

The Tanshikar Spice Farm is a 25-acre working organic spice farm in South Goa. The farm is about an hour and a half’s drive from Agonda Beaches up into the hills on a winding road, through lush green rainforests of the Western Ghats and past the beautiful Netravali waterfall. It is the perfect way to spend an afternoon in the hills learning about spices.\r\nTanshikar Spice Farm\r\nThe farm has been in the family for six generations and is full of spices, coconuts and other fruits, mushrooms and honey.\r\nGauri, our personal tour guide around the Spice Farm is the fifth generation of her family to live and farm here, and her children are the sixth.\r\nThe farm has been many years in the making. It started out as rice fields which her great-great-grandparents harvested. Her great-grandparents then introduced coconut trees and her grandparents planted spice trees in between them and the rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nThe whole family still lives in the 200-year-old traditional house built from mud with floors finished in hardened cow dung. Yes, you read that correct, cow dung. Not only does it harden to a tough finish, but it is also flexible and makes an ideal surface for a busy house.\r\nThe farm has over 40 acres of land, of which 25 are specifically used for growing over 14 different varieties of spice and fruit trees. Everything is organic and they encourage beneficial insects to help tackle bacterias that could damage the plants.\r\nThe bees they keep not just for their honey, but for their help in pollination of the plants and the honey is a welcome by-product.\r\n\r\nThe Guided Tour around the Spice Farm\r\nWe joined with two other couples to tour the spice farm, led by Gauri. As we walked around, she explained about each of the different spices. We were told about the king of spices, black pepper and cardamom, the queen, the potentially lethal properties of nutmeg and the way to pollinate vanilla.\r\nGauri’s intimate knowledge of the spices and how they are grown interwoven with the history of her family and the farm made the time fly by.\r\nWhen we arrived back at the reception, we were each given a gift of a selection of spices and invited to go through to have our lunch.\r\nThe Restaurant\r\nfreshly made bean curry\r\nIncluded in the cost of your ticket is a meal at the Tanshikar restaurant. The vegetarian dishes are served in a buffet style and you help yourself from the clay pots. Our selection included rice, chapati, daal, bean curry, a cabbage salad, potato patties and a lovely spicy lime pickle, all freshly prepared with spices from the farm.\r\ndelicious meal of bean curry, daal, cabbage salad, potato patties, rice and chapati\r\nStaying at the Farm\r\nYou can experience the peace and quiet of the farm by staying in the Ecological Rest House which is set amongst the trees and flowers. Like the main farm building the villas are made from mud. The mud has good thermic qualities, keeping them cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\r\nThe accommodation also includes old Indian-style cottages and Tree House.\r\nVisiting Tanshikar Spice Farm\r\nAddress: The Tanshikar Spice Farm, Netravali, near Smriti Yoga, Sanguem, Goa 403704, India\r\nOpening hours: The farm is open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm seven days a week.\r\nTours: Book tours to Tanshikar Spice Farm on Tripadvisor\r\nThe Spices and Fruits at Tanshikar Spice Farm\r\nVanilla\r\n\r\nTrue vanilla, those lovely scented long black pods bursting full of tiny black seeds, start their life as a climber on other trees. A member of the orchid family, the flowers make it difficult for birds and insects to get to the pollen and on the farm, the workers use a toothpick to individually pollinate each flower. This is one of the reasons that vanilla is so expensive.\r\nFrom these flowers, only one pod grows which takes 9 months to mature. After harvesting, the pods are cured for around another 3 months and then they are ready for use.\r\nCardamom\r\nCardamom pod on the roots of the plant\r\nThe Queen of Spices, cardamom is a member of the ginger family. The prized capsules of cardamon pods grow on shoots from the roots of the plant along the ground.\r\nThis wonderful sweet green pod is used in traditional Indian cuisine and is one of the ingredients of garam masala but is also used to flavour desserts and the ubiquitous chai tea.\r\nGreen, Black and White Pepper\r\ngreen pepper on the stem\r\nDo you know the difference between green, black and white pepper? Well, technically they are all the same but are just peppercorns at different stages.\r\nThe green peppercorns are the freshest of the peppers and are unripe black corns.\r\nThe black corns are the wonderful, hot, slightly orangey, peppercorns that flavour our food, and the milder white peppercorns are the seed of the fruit with the black skin removed.\r\nCinnamon\r\nCinnamon sticks are those long tubes of tightly packed aromatic bark and are taken from the inner bark of the cinnamon trees. Used in Indian cooking for flavouring both sweet and savoury dishes, cinnamon has a wonderful warming sweet taste and is one of the ingredients for garam masala.\r\nCloves\r\nCloves are actually the dried flower buds of the clove tree which are harvested while still immature and then dried. Used in cooking and spice mixes like garam masala, cloves have a pungent slightly sweet and bitter taste. It is also used in preparations for toothache.\r\nCacao\r\nCacao pod on the tree\r\nCacao or cocoa are the basis for most chocolate. It starts life as a large pod on the cacao tree. When they are mature the pods are harvested and then split open to reveal 30-40 beans and surrounding pulp. The beans are then spread out to let them sweat the pulp off. The beans are then fermented and dried.\r\nTurmeric\r\nstump of tumeric\r\nTurmeric, that wonderful yellow spice with a pungent earthy taste and jazzes up rice, spices up drinks and is alleged to be good for our health, starts like as a rhizome at the base of the turmeric plant. The rhizome is then they are used fresh or boiled and ground to reveal the yellow powder to be used in cooking or for dyeing.\r\nNutmeg & Mace\r\nmace – the lacy covering of the nutmeg\r\nNutmeg and mace are produced hand in hand; the mace is the lacy covering that protects the nutmeg nut inside.\r\nDid you know the nutmeg tree can be one of three different sexes? 80% are female, 20% are male and a very rare few produce male one year and female the next. The trees don’t come to their sexual maturity for six to eight years, so when they are planted you don’t know what you are going to get, you just have to be patient.\r\nHalf a small nutmeg grated into warm milk at night will help you sleep, but be careful, three nutmegs can kill!\r\nOther Produce\r\noyster mushrooms\r\nTanshikar Spice Farm also produces chillies, coffee beans, betel nut, pineapples, bananas, cashew nuts and papaya; oyster mushrooms which are grown on compacted straw hung up on rope; honey from their bees in the hives around the farm.\r\nIf you are staying in the south of Goa I would recommend a visit to the Tanshikar Spice Farm for a relaxing and interesting trip.\r\n\r\n'),

I still remember the milieu of sea, sand, and sunshine, which was an incredible experience for the curious child in me. As I grew up, Goa became my go-to destination and I kept going there again and again. I went there with my college friends to celebrate our graduation, with my bestie to mourn and drink and cry when I had my first heartbreak, with my spouse to celebrate our romance, and my colleagues to have a bash after appraisals and so on and on. I only needed reasons and I always found one. And more often than not, my focus was on beaches and pubs with one notable exception – the Basilica of Bom Jesus. Believe it or not, I’ve visited this church on almost all my trips.\r\nSo, what makes this church so special to me and also to the millions that throng there every day? To begin with, it is the most renowned church in Goa and truly a one-of-its-kind monument. Boasting of historical significance and structural uniqueness, it stands as the best church in Goa and there is more than one reason for that. If you are intrigued by this famed church, let me reveal to you what makes it such a matchless destination to visit in Goa.\r\n\r\nA History of 400 Years\r\nFour hundred years is by no means a short timeframe for a monument to leave its mark on the sands of time, isn’t it? Let’s start at the very beginning. The foundation stone of the church was laid way back in 1594. After more than a decade of construction, it was finally completed in 1605. Standing strong since then, this 400-year old church has achieved the distinction of being not just the oldest church in Goa, but also one of the oldest churches in the whole world. This fact in itself places the Basilica of Bom Jesus in a league of its own. Also, it is the first church in India that was raised to the status of a minor basilica in the year 1946. And if you didn’t know, the church is dedicated to the infant Jesus.\r\nMatchless Architecture\r\n\r\nNo, you don’t have to be a connoisseur of architecture to appreciate its beauty. I knew close to nothing about architectural styles when I first visited the church. But the church had an irresistible charm and only when it started growing on me that I began researching more about it and its construction. Here’s everything I know:\r\nOne of the first things I noticed about the Basilica of Bom Jesus was that its exterior has a non-plastered look. This is in sharp distinction to the other churches in North Goa or South Goa for that matter, all of which exhibit plastered exteriors. However, this doesn’t take away anything from the architecture of the magnificent edifice that was built with laterite stone. If anything, it adds a distinctive touch to the whole structure. The church is a splendid example of baroque architecture in India.  \r\nAdorned with triangular roofing, the church boasts of marble mosaic floor. But it is the ornamental interiors of the monument that left me breathless, every time I visited the place. I was fascinated to see the intricate works of precious stones that enhance the beauty of this architectural masterpiece. The spacious church houses the main altar, two chapels, and a sacristy along with a choir. The elaborately gilded altar is among the major attractions of the church. Though the façade is decked with carvings and pillars, the simplistic Renaissance style layout imparts the structure an elegant look. No wonder, the Basilica of Bom Jesus seems to cast a captivating spell on its visitors!\r\nA Church with a Mummy\r\n\r\nA remarkable thing to note about the Basilica of Bom Jesus is that it houses a mummy. Yes, that’s true and that was one of the major attractions when I first visited the church! For me, the word mummy had always been synonymous with Egypt and pyramids, so when I heard there’s a mummy right here in Goa, it kindled my curiosity.  This Goa church mummy is of a renowned saint named Francis Xavier. He was the co-founder of a religious congregation (called the Society of Jesus aka Jesuits) along with St. Ignatius Loyola, who was his close friend.\r\nThere is a fascinating tale related to the mummy. When St. Xavier died in 1552, his body was initially taken to Portuguese Malacca. After a period of two years, his body was shipped to Goa. Going by popular tales, when the body arrived in the church, it was in a fresh condition without any decay. Interestingly, the saint’s mortal remains are in a good condition till this day, more than 400 years after his death. His remains are taken out once every ten years for public viewing. According to prevalent beliefs, the saint possesses miraculous powers of healing. Even today, scores of people visit the church from all over the world to witness this miracle.\r\nThe mummy is kept inside a glass container that is enclosed in a casket made of silver. This casket remains atop the three-tiered bier that was specially built for the purpose by the Duke of Tuscany. He built it in exchange for the saint’s pillow on which his head rested for many years following his death. Apart from these relics, the church also exhibits a huge collection of paintings that are related to the life of the famous saint.\r\nA World Heritage Site\r\nThere’s no denying the fact that the Basilica is among the most revered churches by Christians the world over. It is also among the biggest churches in Goa. But do you know that this church is recognized as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites? This fact again reinstates that it is a class apart from the other famous churches in South Goa and North Goa. When you are in Goa, make time to visit the church and it will be totally worth it, I swear. After all, you don’t get to see a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a 400-year old mummy every other day!\r\nGolden Rose Plant\r\nWondering how a Golden Rose Plant can enhance the significance of a church? Well, the plant acquires significance when it is presented by the Pope himself. It was in the year 1953 that Pope Pius XII gifted the church a Golden Rose Plant to thank the church for its evangelization works done in Goa. As of now, it is the only church in India that has got this plant.  \r\nRelics of Jesuit Rudolf Acquaviva and the Others\r\nI was surprised to know that the Basilica of Bom Jesus is home to the relics of many other saints apart from St. Francis Xavier. Among them are Jesuit Rudolf Acquaviva and his companions Antoni Francisci, Francisc Aranea, Alphons Paceco, and Petrus Berni. They were martyred in 1583 at Cuncolim. One of the rooms of the church preserves their relics.\r\nIf you are a history buff, you will love to know that Jesuit Rudolf Acquaviva was a bosom friend of Emperor Akbar. Legend has it that such was the influence of Acquaviva on Akbar that he had even convinced the Emperor to convert to Christianity. You can even find the relics of several Japanese saints like Diogo Cisary, Paul Miqui, Joao Goto, and their companions in one of the rooms within the church.\r\nTravel Trivia for Visitors\r\nThe church remains busiest during the Feast of St. Francis Xavier. This is an annual fest held every year on the third day of December. A nine-day devotional novena precedes this feast. Open-air masses and other festivities mark the days. Large crowds accumulate at the church complex during this annual feast to take part in the festivities and masses. If you are interested in attending the festivities, plan your trip during that time of the year. In case you prefer a less crowded atmosphere, it will be best to visit the church at other times of the year.\r\nBut if you want to witness the exposition of St. Francis Xavier, you will have to wait for some more years for that. The saint was last given an exposition in the year 2014. That means you won’t get the next opportunity to witness this event before 2024.  \r\nLocation: Near Gandhi Circle, Old Goa Rd, Velha Goa\r\nVisiting Time\r\n09.00 am to 06.30 pm; Mon – Sat\r\n10.30 am to 06.30 pm; Sunday\r\nEntry Fee: Free entry\r\nPhotography: No restriction\r\nGuide: You can take a guided tour\r\nMass Timings\r\n07.00 am and 08.00 am; Mon – Sat (in Konkani)\r\n08.00 am and 09.15 am; Sun (in Konkani)\r\n10.15 am; Sunday (in English)\r\nConfession: 05.00 pm to 06.00; every day in the sacristy\r\nThere is no doubt that the Basilica of Bom Jesus tops the chart of the most visited churches in South Goa as well as North Goa. For me, it is not just a religious destination; it is also a cultural landmark. Just like the sandy beaches are an integral part of Goa’s identity, the church also remains deep in the cultural web of the place. So, when you plan your visit to Goa, do not miss out on this heritage destination. But do not forget the other major attractions of Goa, like the Aguada Fort, Mayem Lake, Cabo Fort, and the Church of St Francis of Assisi to name a few. Anjuna Beach, Baga Beach, Calangute Beach, and Palolem Beach are also must-visit places. (Ah, here I go again, talking about beaches!)\r\nA Few Additional Tips\r\nIf you plan your travel during the festive season of Christmas and New Year, make sure to book hotels in Goa well in advance. That is the time when Goa witnesses the maximum rush. In case you want to go on a budget trip to Goa, the best time is to go during the off-season. Whether you are planning your visit during the tourist season or the off-season, one thing is sure: Goa is going to offer you a memorable experience that you will live to cherish forever. So, what are you waiting for? Book your tickets and get ready to be in the land of sand and the sun where infant Jesus awaits you in the Basilica of Bom Jesus\r\n\r\n'),

Being the capital of the Vijayanagar Empire during the 14th century AD, this is a city drenched in history and splendour. In the 1500s, it even became the world’s second-largest and India’s richest cities. However, owing to incessant invasions by the Mughal sultanates and the defeat of the Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is now a hollow echo of its past. One of the structures that witnessed it all and still stood high was the Lotus Mahal in Hampi. Also known as Kamal Mahal and Chitrangini Mahal, the Lotus temple was built in the 16th century in the Zenana Enclosure that houses quite a few interesting structures like the Basement of the Queen’s Palace, Treasury Building, Water Pavilion, and the Watch Towers.\r\nLotus Palace in Hampi is one of the best-preserved courtly structures here. It is believed that this is where the Queen of Krishna Deva Raya used to stay during summers. The ladies of the empire also spent their leisure time here. So, if you are planning on a Hampi tour package, you should not miss out on Chitrangini Mahal.\r\nThe Architecture of Lotus Palace\r\nThe Lotus Temple in Hampi is a splendid example of a harmonious architectural combination of Indian and Islamic (or Saracenic) architectural styles. Other than this, the overall plan of the palace is exceptional which is often praised for the ingenuity of the Vijayanagar artisans. This is what makes it one of the top places to visit in Hampi.\r\nWith cusped arches and intricate decorations, the ground floor has a spectator section that was once used by the royals for the congregation. There also exists an inclined eave that surrounds the edifice. The place gets its name from its archways that resemble the petals of a lotus. This gives the entire structure the shape of a half-open lotus bud. Also, the dome in the centre is carved in the shape of a lotus bud while towers are pyramidal in shape. This further enhances the lotus-like appearance of the Lotus Mahal. There are about 24 pillars that support the arched windows and balcony of the palace.\r\nYou can then go up to the first floor which is a closed pavilion with various oblong windows and distinct arches overlooking the impeccably manicured garden. Each of these windows has wooden blinds which is not a very common feature in other Hampi ruins. It is believed that these blinds were for the royal women. Coming to the roof, it contains nine superstructures that resemble the shikharas majorly found in Hindu temples. You can also come across a number of exquisite carvings of artistic patterns of sea creatures and birds that enhance the overall beauty of the Kamal Mahal in Hampi. One of the most prominent carvings is that of Makara Torana which is a significant sea creature in Hindu mythology. It is also considered to be the vehicle of Goddess Ganga.\r\nThe pipeline work that can be spotted between the arches and sides of the roof is the reason why Kamal Mahal in Hampi was the queen’s place to relax. This was apparently used to cool the palace and maintain its temperature. Also, to ensure the safety of the queen and other royal women, there were three watchtowers that were used to keep an eye on intruders.\r\nThings to Do\r\nPhotography\r\nOne can roam around the Lotus Temple in Hampi and click some stunning pictures of the extraordinary architecture, the lush green gardens, and the ruined, damp walls. Each corner of the palace has a unique story to tell and you can capture it all with your camera. The place looks even more gorgeous during sunset. You can also witness this magnificent structure being illuminated at night which offers a spectacular sight. It is definitely one of the most mesmerising views in Hampi. This is also one of the best times to observe its awe-inspiring architecture and appreciate the artisans of that time.\r\nPicnic\r\nWhether you are travelling alone or with family, this is a place where you would want to spend a little more time. You can either have a fun picnic with your loved ones in the garden area at Lotus Palace in Hampi or even enjoy a nap under the tree shade. The entire place remains cool even during the day, so it can be a great spot to avoid the scorching heat.\r\nVisit the Elephants’ Stable\r\nThe elephant stable is located just outside the Zenana Enclosure and is a spot that should not be missed out on. This is a remarkable structure that was once used to provide shelter to the royal elephants of the Vijayanagar Empire. The structure has an array of eleven massive domed chambers which are interconnected with arched openings. Each of these chambers can accommodate two elephants at once.\r\nVisit the Vittala Temple\r\nThe Vittala Temple is one of the most significant and ornate of the Vijayanagar Empire. Housing various halls, shrines, and pavilions every corner of this temple is something that should not be missed out on. Some of the most prominent ones are the shrine of the Goddess (also known as Devi shrine), Ranga Mantapa, Maha Mantapa – the main hall (also known as Sabha Mantapa), Kalyana Mantapa (marriage hall), Utsava Mantapa (festival hall), and the Stone Chariot. Also do not forget to listen to the magical tunes of the Musical Pillars in Ranga Mantapa.\r\nHow to Reach\r\nThe Lotus Palace in Hampi is easily accessible by road. Hampi is well-connected to almost all the major towns and cities in Karnataka. Also, there are a number of buses and private taxis that can help you reach Hampi. The nearest town to Hampi that has an airport is Ballari (Bellary) which is situated at a distance of about 64 kilometres from Hampi. The nearest railway station is located in Hosapete (Hospet) and is 10 kilometres away from Hampi.\r\nSo, if you are planning to visit this dreamlike place soon, here is some information that will help. Also, you can get more Lotus Mahal, Hampi information in Kannada, Hindi, or English at the official website.\r\nEntry Timings: 08:00 AM – 06:00 PM\r\nLotus Palace Fee Details\r\nIndian Citizens: INR 20\r\nForeigners: INR 250\r\nHistory might have swallowed up a lot of structures here in Hampi, but thankfully it spared the Lotus Palace in Hampi which is an utter delight to explore. With ornate superstructures, stucco ornaments, and cornices, it is a place that will tune in to your emotions.\r\n\r\n');

One picture of Hampi had stuck to me for my life. The picture of a stone chariot standing in an open courtyard. It vaguely reminded me of the temple of Konark but not exactly. This November, I was lucky enough to be able to fulfill my dream. I caught not only a glimpse of the exclusive chariot but also posed with it. And it all happened at the Vijaya Vittala Temple of Hampi.\r\nHere’s an account of my memorable trip to this remarkable temple – The Temple of Vijaya Vittala\r\n\r\nHampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in India located in east-central Karnataka. Hampi was a prosperous city and the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century. Vijayanagara was a rich kingdom and was frequented by traders from all over the world. As you read on, you will see evidence (in stone) substantiating this claim.\r\nThe Kingdom of Vijayanagara was defeated by Muslim Sultanates in the 16th century. The capital of Hampi was left in ruins after that. Ancient temples, royal enclosures, watch-towers, and remains of a palace dot the landscape of Hampi today. And the Vijaya Vittala Temple stands tall among all of them. It is one of the most iconic remains of the Vijayanagara legacy. Let’s see what makes Vijaya Vittala special.\r\nWhy Is Vijaya Vittala Temple Unique?\r\n\r\nVijaya Vittala is a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu of the Hindu Trinity (Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva). It is built in the Dravidian architectural style.  No worship is offered at the temple now and there is no deity inside the inner sanctum. There are no written records on when and how the figure of Vishnu was removed from the temple. So, that aspect still remains a mystery.\r\nThe Gopura of the Temple – A Typical Component of Dravidian Architecture\r\nThe temple stands apart from the other temples in the complex of Hampi ruins. And I believe this is so because of three important factors that I list below. We took a guide inside the temple complex and I feel that was a very good thing to do. Lately, I have started appreciating the services of local tour guides. They may not always know everything but they do know some interesting bits and pieces that I will never figure out when I am on my own. Our guide was kind enough to point out a number of details that I will talk about below.\r\nChariot Temple\r\n\r\nVijaya Vittala is the only temple in Hampi that possesses a stone chariot in the front courtyard. In fact, it is one of the three temples in India that have stone chariots. The other two are in Konark and Mahabalipuram.  The stone chariot is a big attraction at the temple and draws tourists from near and far.\r\nThe chariot appears like a monolith but it actually isn’t. It is built out of multiple stone slabs, carved and stacked on each other. The links are cleverly hidden. This is something your tour guide will point out the first thing as you enter the complex.\r\n\r\nTo understand better the importance of this chariot, let’s take a small walk in history!\r\nPersistent animosity between the Rayas of Vijayanagara and the Gajapatis of Kalinga (present state of Odisha) led to a war that was fought on the Kalinga soil. The Rayas came, fought, and left but not before being dazzled by the beauty of the Sun Temple at Konark. That is when Krishnadevaraya came back and decided to build a similar chariot-styled temple in Hampi. The chariot is actually a small shrine dedicated to the carrier bird of Lord Vishnu – Garuda. It is believed that there was a big statue of Garuda atop the chariot but it no longer exists.\r\nAn image of Garuda complete with wings stands inside the inner sanctum. Presence of this image confirms the fact that it was indeed a Vishnu temple and not a Shiva one. A stone ladder, that stands in front of the shrine, was used to climb up and offer worship to Garuda.\r\nCarvings on the chariot are carved out of stone. They are intricate and beautiful. In the olden days, they were painted beautiful hues of red, yellow, and green. However, much of the color has been lost to the forces of nature. But if you have a tour guide or if you have read my travel guide, you will know where to still find some of the colors – after a whopping 500 years! Closely look underneath the hood of the chariot and you will see some beautifully colored patterns still visible. Look for any area that has not been affected by sun, wind, and rains and you will find exquisite colors from centuries ago.\r\n\r\nMusical Pillars\r\n\r\nThe Musical Pillars of Vijaya Vittala Temple are the next most famous thing inside the complex. I had heard quite a bit about them before traveling here. And I was excited to see them. The very fact that a set of pillars could produce music without any other instrument had perked my interests a great deal. But when I arrived at the temple, I was aghast to see the main temple closed to visitors for renovation. We could admire the pillars from outside as much as we wanted but we were not allowed to touch them or climb into the premises! I was disappointed. I was so looking forward to listening to some ancient music.\r\nObviously, our guide came to the rescue. He took us to another temple (mandapa) on the side and gave us a live music show at the pillars there. The guide knew exactly where to tap and out came the most appealing music I had ever heard. I was suddenly taken back 500 years when the all the pillars came to life together! Felt like a garden in springtime.\r\n\r\nVijaya Vittala Temple has 56 musical pillars and they are often called the Saregama Pillars. These pillars can be tapped with your thumb to generate music similar to the notes of Saregama. The concept of musical pillars is not new in South Indian architecture. They have been found in a number of other temples including the Nellaiappar Temple in Tirunelveli and Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. Research suggests that these pillars produce music because of the presence of metallic ore and large amounts of silica in the rocks used to carve the pillars.\r\nExquisite Carvings\r\n\r\nNo temple in Hampi is as exquisitely carved as the Vittala temple. In fact, this temple is one of the finest examples of an ornately-carved-pillared Kalyanamantapa. Kalyanamantapa is a pillared hall used for weddings.\r\n\r\nYou will also find a number of carvings in the bottom part of the mantapa that depict life from 500 years ago. There are images of people buying the right kind of horses, traders coming in to trade their goods, and people going about their daily lives. You can see Chinese, Portuguese, and other European traders depicted in these friezes. This gives a clear indication of prosperous times and burgeoning trade relations of the Vijayanagara Empire with the rest of the world.\r\nTickets & Other Logistics\r\n \r\nThe majestic temple of Vijaya Vittala is open from 8:30 am – 5 pm every day of the week. Indians need to pay an entry fee of INR 40 while the amount is for foreigners is $8.5. Vehicles are not allowed to travel on the last one kilometer of the road leading to the temple which is why you either need to walk or take a ride in the golf cart provided at the front gate. That costs another INR 10 per person. Kids ride free.\r\nA View of The Hampi Market\r\nThe walk is a pleasant one if your legs are good and the sun is not high up in the sky. It can really hot during the day and it is usually advisable to ride the golf cart if you are planning a midday visit. The road is dusty too. But the views are amazing. While walking on the path, you will notice many smaller temples and mantapas precariously balanced on huge boulders. You will also get a chance to see the remains of a Hampi market that used to congregate hundreds of years ago. Nearby is also a stepped well or Pushkarini that provided water for ablutions and other religious ceremonies.\r\nView from the dusty road\r\nHow To Get To Hampi\r\nYou can get to Hampi from Mumbai or Bangalore. We took a flight from Mumbai to Bangalore and then boarded the Hampi Express from Yelahanka Junction – Railway Station in Bangalore. That got us till Hospet and we stayed in Hospet a couple of days and explored Hampi. Hampi is about an hour’s ride from Hospet. And Hospet provides better accommodation and eating options.\r\n\r\nBest Time To Go\r\nThe best time to visit Hampi or anywhere close by is between November – February. December and January are the peak traffic months. It gets exceptionally hot in the summers and therefore, summer is definitely not a good time to visit. Even during winters, the sun can be harsh. Hampi is an open museum and there is not much cover from the heat. So, always carry sufficient water, sunscreen, and your hat if you wish to.\r\n\r\n\r\nHampi was a trip down the memory lane for me. And Vijaya Vittala Temple was the cherry on top. I would definitely want to go back there one day. Till then, the stone chariot and the musical pillars will be cherished memories.\r\n\r\n'),
(33, 'Hampi', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Hampi_virupaksha_temple.jpg', '\r\nHampi is an open museum of ancient, ruined temples. And like every other museum in this world, Hampi has its own set of showstoppers. The Vijaya Vittala Temple with its beautiful stone chariot is one of them. The other is a famous living temple – The Virupaksha Temple of Hampi. In this post, I write about this unique temple and why it enthralled me to bits.\r\nWhy Virupaksha?\r\nI am not a temple person. I will not make an early morning journey to pray at a temple. But talk to me about a temple with exquisite architecture and beautiful murals, you will find me up at 5 in the morning. Excited and raring to go! Virupaksha was a similar story.\r\n\r\nAncient Indian Temples have always fascinated me. It is almost impossible to find so much art and architecture anywhere else in the world. Exploring this art is my way of paying homage to the God that resides within these sanctuaries. Virupaksha in Hampi was one such expedition. A 3-headed Nandi, beautifully exquisite murals, and an upside-down shadow – who knew the temple had so much to offer!\r\nCome, let’s explore the famous Virupaksha Temple of Hampi together!\r\nAfter a quick freshening up, the three of us were ready to go. We had just arrived in Hampi and our first stop was going to be the Virupaksha Temple. Ramu, our tuk-tuk chauffeur for the next two days, drove us around effortlessly and parked right by the side of what remained of the Hampi Bazaar. \r\nWhat remains of the ancient Hampi Bazaar\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked to my left and there stood the tall, yellow silhouette of the Virupaksha Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva of the Hindu trinity – Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. It is an important pilgrimage center for Hindus even today. It was built in the early 7th century but not in the grand form that we see today. Much of it was added between the 14th and 16th century, especially during the rule of King Krishna Deva Raya.\r\n\r\nThe Front Courtyard\r\nWe entered through the Gopuram or the Entrance Spire into an open courtyard and for a moment, I was a little disappointed by the simplicity of it all. There was an old, dilapidated mandapa to my left and a bangle shop to my right. I craned my neck to see a “Please remove your shoes here” sign by the side of the shop. Nothing much. Yet!\r\nA quintessential shop in many Indian temples\r\nYet another gopura in front invited me. Beyond that, I could clearly see the main shrine. I wanted to hop in there. But not before my tour guide pointed out to two important things in the front courtyard. I would not have noticed those without him.\r\n\r\nThe 3-Headed Nandi\r\nThe first was a three-headed Nandi (a bull that is the carrier of Shiva of the Hindu trinity). Virupaksha is unique because it is the only temple along the length and breadth of India that possesses such an image of Nandi. The exact origins of a Nandi like this are not known but it was probably done to honor all three of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva. My guide claims that “anyone who comes to Hampi and does not see the 3-headed bull has not really seen anything”. \r\n\r\nEmblem of Vijayanagara Kingdom\r\nThe second is the emblem of Vijayanagara Kingdom that is carved pretty inconspicuously into a rock on my right. Varaha (wild boar), the sun, the moon, and a dagger complete it. As you travel through Hampi, you will notice wild boars in plenty, even today.\r\n\r\nThe Inner Sanctum\r\nWe remove our shoes at the nondescript shoe stand and enter into the inner courtyard that houses the inner sanctum and the Ranga Mandapa that leads to it. On my left I see a huge elephant being fed by its mahout. Surprise Surprise! The temple has its own elephant!\r\nIn front is the main shrine which seems abuzz with activity. And to my right are smaller peripheral temples. \r\n\r\nA Wedding in the Temple\r\nI cannot believe my luck when I realize that there is a wedding, one of the most unique Indian experiences, going on inside the temple. A wedding is one of the most unique The whole place is alive with the chanting of mantras and vibrant with colors. The bride and bridegroom are dressed in white. We are just in time to catch the last of the festivities. \r\n\r\nThe Murals\r\nAs I pop into the Ranga Mandapa, my guide points up to the ceiling to reveal some pretty amazing murals. Some of these have been badly restored probably leading to more damage. But what remains is exquisite. \r\n\r\nThe murals are the most vibrant on the ceiling of the Ranga Mandapa. However, a few are still visible in some of the peripheral temples. These paintings are over 600 years old and depict scenes from Hindu mythology. The Ranga Mandapa is the area where all social activities took place. This place was no doubt decked up the most, with both carvings and paintings, to convey the power of the King that built it.\r\n\r\nInside the Ranga Mandapa after the wedding got over\r\nAn Inverted Gopura!\r\nOur guide then ushers us out quickly and takes us to an almost-secretive chamber at the back of the temple. I say almost because, like anywhere in India, we were not the only people in there! There is another couple too with a guide which tells us that this is probably one of the guides’ many trade secrets. There is a small hole in the wall in front of us and we wait for my guide to climb up and do some acrobatics. In a moment, we see an inverted shadow of the Gopura on the wall behind. The small hole had created a pinhole effect causing the upsidedown shadow and when this happens at a revered place, a number of theories come up. Maybe that is how mythology is created!\r\n\r\nWhat’s In The Periphery?\r\nWe move out to the peripheral temples to catch glimpses of other deities and their own Ranga Mandapas. All of them had been adorned with paintings and torans (carved hanging on the door). But few retain them or their sheen. \r\n\r\nFor more on beautiful torans and intricate carvings, read my post on the Temples of Pattadakal.\r\nThe Family Tree\r\nA huge chart on the wall catches my eye. It is the family tree of all dynasties that ruled the Kingdom of Vijayanagara with the emblem in middle. The letters fade out in many places. But the glory stays alive in the temples and palaces they built! \r\n\r\nWhere Is The Elephant?\r\nThe temple has its own elephant that it uses for processions – a long-lived tradition of Indian temples. You can view the majestic animal in its shed on your left as you enter the inner courtyard. Apparently, the animal blesses you if you offer it 10 Indian Rupees. We never tried!\r\n\r\nTickets and Other Logistics\r\nThere is no ticket to enter the temple but you have to pay INR 50 to bring your camera in. Tour guides, in their customary white uniform, are available right at the entrance. You don’t have to find them. They will find you. We paid our guide INR 300 to show us the temple. Toilets are available outside the temple in the new Hampi market. Clean, western toilets are hard to come by. Indian squat toilets are common. It is always advisable to carry tissues and hand sanitizers.\r\n\r\nHelps To Know\r\nThere are monkeys inside the temple. Avoid holding food and bright, dazzling things in your hand or dangling anywhere around in order to be safe.\r\nVirupaksha is a living temple which means worship is still offered here. You might have to encounter family celebrations and larger crowds.\r\nYou will also need to leave your shoes at the shoe counter behind the shop in the outer courtyard. A very nominal fee is charged for that.\r\nYou will be expected to leave a little something when you seek blessings at the shrines where worship is offered. However, it is completely okay to say no and move on if you are not interested.\r\nThe modern market behind Hampi Bazaar stocks a lot of souvenirs if you wish to buy some.\r\nHampi’s famous restaurant, Mango Tree, is 5minute away from the Virupaksha Temple. Their fresh fruit juices are delicious.\r\n\r\nFor details on how to get to Hampi and what is the best time to go there, please refer to my guide on Vijaya Vittala Temple and The Musical Pillars of Hampi.\r\nI had a great time at the Virupaksha Temple of Hampi. It stood tall among those boulders and was a glowing example of human effort and dedication. Even though my favorite temple in Hampi was the Vijaya Vittala Temple, Virupaksha made a strong impression on me. Vittala Temple was the epitome of glorious architecture and beautiful carvings whereas Virupaksha was the paragon of stunning murals. Given a choice, I would probably pick both. Which one would you pick? Let me know in the comments below and let’s get the conversation started.\r\n\r\n'),
(34, 'Jaipur', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/09/jaipur-main.jpg?width=1200', 'Amer Fort is rated as one of the top things to do in Jaipur. It is a must-visit place in Jaipur. Recently, Amer Fort has been listed as one of the 17 iconic tourist sites identified by the Ministry Of Tourism of India. Amer Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a part of the “Hill Forts of Rajasthan” cluster. People call it by many names like Amber Palace, Amer Ka Kila, Amber Fort, and so on. Even though it is commonly called a fort, in reality, it is a palace since it was a residential unit of the royal family.\r\nHow to explore Amer Fort?\r\nThe ideal walking plan to explore Amer Fort should be in the following order:\r\nJaleb Chowk\r\nDiwan-E-Aam\r\nGanesh Pol\r\nHammam\r\nDiwan E Khas/ Sheesh Mahal\r\nSukh Niwas\r\nSuhag Mandir\r\nZenana Deori\r\nAmer-Jaigarh Tunnel\r\nSheela Mata Mandir\r\nNakkarkhana\r\nDilaram Bagh can be covered either at the start of your visit or towards the end.

Only important people were allowed entry beyond this gate. It is incredibly beautiful and is one of the most photographed locations in Amer Fort. It’s a popular selfie point too. Pol refers to a gate in the local dialect. Ganesh Pol is the finest specimen of amalgamation of the Mughal and Rajput influences in creating a masterpiece.\r\nOld world charm?\r\nNamed after Hindu God Ganesha, Ganesh Pol is symbolic of the importance Lord Ganesha has in the lives of people. As per Hindu belief, Ganesha’s blessing is sought before starting any auspicious work as he can help tide over any obstacles. It is common to find an idol of Ganesha placed at the entrance in Indian homes. Therefore it not surprising if this gate is dedicated to him as it leads to the residential area of the royal family.\r\n\r\nTip: Do visit viewing deck above Ganesh Pol called Suhag Mandir. It has latticed windows used as a viewing deck by the royal women as they were not allowed to make a public appearance. Don’t miss the beautiful frescoes inspired by the Mughal influence on the wall. Mughal influence traces its roots to Central Asia in Bukhara, Uzbekistan.\r\nThe amalgamation of Mughal and Rajput styles. Suhag Mandir\r\nDiwan e Aam\r\nDiwan-e-Aam, Amer Fort Jaipur\r\nDiwan-e-Aam is a court where the king used to meet his administrative officials and appeared before important people during auspicious & important occasions. Built during the late 16th century, it features a beautiful amalgamation of two different architectural styles -Mughal and Rajput. Pillars in this hall are constructed using red sandstone as well as white marble.\r\nOrnate and beautiful pillars of Diwan-e-aam\r\nElephant head and florally patterned vines are two distinct design elements to influence the design of pillars in this hall.\r\nTip: You can have a panoramic view of Maota, Dilaram garden and Jaleb Chowk from Diwan-e-Aam.\r\nDiwan e Aam as seen from Jaleb Chowk, a courtyard meant for assembly of the army.\r\nSheesh Mahal or Diwan-e-Khas\r\nDiwan-e-Khas or Sheesh Mahal at Amer Fort, Jaipur.\r\nThe Sheesh Mahal is considered as a “Jewel in the crown”. Diwan-e-Khaas means a place where the king would meet only close and important people. therefore, Sheesh Mahal refers to a section where walls and ceilings are covered with millions of small mirrors. Sheesh=mirror.\r\nSheesh MahalSheesh Mahal, a close-up picture\r\nDuring the night these mirrors reflect the light of a torch or wick, resembling stars in the sky. This technique of mirror work on walls and ceilings was popular during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The first specimen of Sheesh Mahal was created in the Lahore fort in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nTip: Apart from the mirror work, don’t miss the fine inlay work on Makrana (white marble) in Diwan-e-Khas and the magic flower.\r\nThe magic flower at Sheesh Mahal\r\nThe magic flower is carved in the marble slabs at the base of pillars in Diwan-e-Khas. You can easily recognize it as it has flowers, leaves, & butterflies hovering around it. This design contains 7 unique & distinct design elements -a scorpion, fishtail, a hooded cobra, a lotus flower, trunk of an elephant, a lion’s tail, and lastly cob corn. Truly, it’s a masterpiece; uncommon to find one these days.\r\nTourist at Sheesh Mahal, Amer\r\nSukh Mahal or Sukh Mandir\r\nSukh Mahal and The Mughal garden.\r\nSukh Mahal or Sukh Mandir is just across Sheesh Mahal. It was a personal chamber of the king, it features a mechanism to keep the premises cool even during peak summer.

Zenana section has personal chambers of the queens and royal women. Some people call it a harem. The chambers were designed in a way that the king finds his way to any of them discreetly to rule out a feeling of jealousy among the queens. Personal attendants of queens too lived in these chambers.\r\n\r\nBaradari at Man Singh Mahal\r\nMan Singh Mahal is not to be missed as it was constructed during the Mughal emperor Akbar’s visit to Amer and completed in 1599 AD. A stone slab is written in Farsi (Persian) having a message of Akbar adorns one of the walls here. A pavilion or Baradari can be found in the center of Man Singh Mahal. As per a popular legend, this pavilion was a meeting place for the queens.\r\nAmer Fort to Jaigarh Fort tunnel\r\nAmer Fort Tunnel to Jaigarh Fort\r\nAmer tunnel was discovered recently as no one knew about its existence for years. You can walk through the Amer Fort tunnel to Jaigarh Fort. It was an escape route in case of an emergency, especially during a siege. It connects with Diwan e Aam, Man Singh Mahal, and Janana Deori. The Amer tunnel is subterraneous only to a point, afterward, it is roofless.\r\nTip: You need to plan for a pick-up at Jaigarh Fort if you wish to walk through the Amer tunnel. Taxi/ Tuk-Tuk/ Auto-Rickshaw is not available on-demand at Jaigarh Fort for your return journey.\r\nShila Mata Temple\r\nSheela Mata temple has an interesting history. Maharajah Man Singh while fighting against the local king in Jessore, Bengal (now Bangladesh) in the 16th century could only secure the win after worshipping a local deity. He brought back the idol in a form of the stone slab and installed it in Amer Fort. A custom of offering a goat sacrifice was followed for centuries but was abandoned in the later years. The ownership and management of this temple are retained by the descendants of the royal family while the government retains & manages the Amer Fort. The temple is made from Makrana White marbles, one of the best white marble in the world. Temple follows a strict policy of not allowing leather goods, shoes, socks, wallets, cameras and mobile phones inside the temple. The sentry can be rude at times.\r\nSheela Mata Mandir\r\nNaqqar Khana/  Naubat Khana\r\nNaqqar Khana is in Chand Pol or west gate close to the elephant ride de-boarding point. The word Naqqar means drums also called Nakkara/ Nagada.\r\nDid you notice the drum on the upper deck of the Chandpol gate?\r\nThe musician would play a variety of music at Nakkarkhana using an array of musical instruments during ancient times. Out of these drums and Karna were the most prominent ones.  Live music is played every morning using the old instruments to recreate an experience of a bygone era during the elephant rides. It is surely a unique Amer experience.\r\nA variety of ancient Indian instruments formed part of Nakkar Khana at Amer Fort, Jaipur.\r\nHammam\r\nHamam or bath is one of the most overlooked sections of Amer Fort. It’s an astonishing experience. I was surprised to learn how techniques were used for hot and cold bath experience in the days when technology was not available. The artisans in ancient times were able to recreate what we experience today by channeling water and airflow. Hamman or bath was directly accessible from Sheesh Mahal.\r\nBathtub constructed from white Makrana marble at Hamman\r\nDilaram Bagh\r\nAlthough commonly referred to as Dilaram Bagh, it is actually Dil-Aaram Bagh.

Other options include hiring a tuk-tuk/autorickshaw and a taxi.  Finding a taxi or auto-rickshaw/tuk-tuk from Amer to Jaipur is not difficult. You can also use the UBER or Ola app for hiring a taxi.\r\n\r\nAmer Fort Tickets And Entry Fee Charges\r\nAmer Fort Entry ticket is priced at Rs 100 for Indian visitor, Rs 500 for a foreign visitor, Rs 100 for foreign students, and Rs 10 for Indian students ( student/ school identity card is mandatory for availing subsidized price).\r\nYou can buy a composite ticket to save money. This composite ticket works well for these sites – Amer Fort, Albert Hall, Jantar Mantar, Nahargarh Fort, Isar Lat, Sisodia Rani Garden, and Vidhyadar Garden. Composite ticket costs Rs 300 for Indian visitor, Rs 40 for Indian students, Rs 200 for foreign students, and Rs 1000 for a foreign visitor.

The first one is opposite to the fort on the main road near the elephant ride boarding point. There is a small privately managed parking lot where you can park your car. It is difficult to find space here during the high season. If you choose to park here then you can hire a jeep to take you to the fort entrance.\r\n\r\nThe second option is to drive your car to the parking lot behind the Amer Fort. You need to drive through the lanes of Amer town to reach this parking lot. The advantage is that you get to reach the fort directly. Do note that during the high season finding a parking spot becomes difficult. The trick is to park furthest to avoid a traffic jam. The parking charges are reasonable as compared to the one on the main road.\r\nAmer Fort parking lot near Chandpol\r\nHow to reach Amer Fort\r\nAmer Fort is well-connected with Jaipur through public bus service, auto-rickshaw/ tuk-tuk, and taxis.

The best way is to walk to Amer Fort when the weather is pleasant because it allows you to enjoy the beautiful views.\r\n\r\nPlaces To Visit Near Amer Fort\r\nThere are many things which can be clubbed up with your Amer visit. Here are a few places and experiences that can be added to make it a more compelling trip.\r\nPanna Meena Kund\r\nPanna Meena Kund is a beautifully restored ancient step-well that you can add to your Amer Fort visit. This Baori or step-well is located in Amer Town and can be easily reached with the help of google maps. It’s an active structure which is still used by the local community (not for drinking purpose though). You can find the complete details in my post on Panna Meena Kund -Hidden Jewel Of Amer\r\n\r\nJagat Shiromani Temple\r\nJagat Shiromani Temple is one of its kind. Masterpiece. The temple has beautiful carvings and is built using a variety of stones. There is an interesting story as to why this was constructed. You can find the complete details in my post on Jagat Shiromani Temple.\r\n\r\nAmbikeshwar Mahadev Temple\r\nAmbikeshwar Temple can easily pass off as an ordinary temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. However, the uniqueness of the temple is that it is set lower than the road level. It has a Shiva lingam which is set below the ground. During monsoon, the temple gets submerged in water. You can find the complete details in my post – Ambikeshwar Temple, A protagonist in the history of Amer\r\n\r\nAnokhi Museum Of Hand Printing Jaipur\r\nThe Anokhi Museum is set in an old restored haveli of Amer. Anokhi is a Jaipur based brand engaged in the business of hand block printed garments. You can visit the Anokhi museum to explore the history of organic hand block printed fabric for which Jaipur is famous. One can explore many types of hand blocking printing techniques like Dabu, Ajrakh, and Bagh among others. Read The Anokhi Museum- Truly Anokhi?\r\nThe Anokhi Museum\r\nCheck out my previous post on 5 Reasons why I love Amer Fort.\r\nAmer Fort Light and Sound Show \r\nIf you love exploring the history of Amer Fort, don’t miss Amer Light and Sound Show which takes place every evening near Kesar Kyari in Maota lake, Amer. This show runs in two editions – Hindi and English. The cost of Amer Fort light and sound show is around Rs 300. The narratives of this show feature famous Indian superstar Amitabh Bachchan.\r\nKesar Kyari, at Maota lake, the venue for Amer Lights and Sound show.\r\nIt is being claimed that years ago Kesar or saffron was grown in this garden. The logic for having this garden in the middle of a lake is that water helped create a suitable climate to grow Kesar. As such Jaipur or Rajasthan doesn’t have conducive weather conditions for growing saffron. The only place where saffron is cultivated on a big scale in India is Kashmir. It is likely that the idea of growing saffron in Jaipur came into being during the conquest missions of Raja Man Singh I who fought for the Mughals till Persian borders. We really have no clue whether they were successful in growing saffron or not. All we are left with is the name – Kesar Kyari. Currently, assorted plants have been planted here.\r\nJaigarh Fort\r\nEven though most people club their visit to Jaigarh Fort with Nahargarh Fort, few adventurous people prefer to visit Jaigarh Fort from Amer Fort. Jaigarh Fort was built as a defense mechanism for Amer Fort and therefore it is perched higher than Amer Fort.\r\nJaigarh ort as seen from Amer Fort\r\nBoth these forts are connected through a walkway and a tunnel. I have already featured the tunnel earlier in this blog. One of the prime attractions of Jaigarh Fort is the Jaivan cannon, considered one of the biggest cannons in the world. Technically,  Jaivan makes in the list of iron balls/ shots category only for there are other huge cannons that used either stone shots or explosive shells.\r\nThe walkway that starts from Amer Fort leads to this entrance of Jaigarh Fort\r\nHow to reach Jaigarh Fort from Amer Fort\r\nYou can either use the Amer-Jaigarh tunnel to reach Jaigarh Fort or use the pathway. The pathway can be accessed from the Surajpol gate. Ask one of the guards to help you locate the walking path. The Amer Jaigarh tunnel merges into this path once it ceases to be subterraneous. Do note that this pathway is uphill; not difficult but it will require effort and time. Certainly not recommended in the summer season! Amer Fort to Jaigarh Fort walking route should be attempted only by fit and adventurous people because it requires a lot of time, energy, and efforts. Here is a picture of the walking route.\r\n\r\nHire a Guide for Amer Fort? \r\nIt’s best to hire an approved guide or an audio guide when you visit Amer Fort. Without context and information, you probably won’t enjoy your visit to Amer Fort. Official guides charge Rs 200 to Rs 500 for a tour. Check for valid identification of a guide. Only authorized guides are permitted for tours in Amer Fort.\r\n\r\nTourist Scams in Jaipur\r\nDo not fall for the tourist trap and scam popular in Jaipur in the name of a “Factory visit” or a “Museum tour”. Guides and drivers lure the tourists in tourist shops & emporiums and earn hefty commissions. Stay clear of any sweet-sounding deals. Amer road is full of such “tourist traps”.\r\nVendors luring tourists with their wares.\r\nRestaurants at Amer Fort\r\n If you love touristy experiences you can try an upmarket restaurant in Amer Fort – 1165 AD near Shila Mata temple. Apart from this, there’s a Café Coffee Day outlet near the exit gate.\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit shabby but popular among the tourists. The best place to enjoy your coffee is the one overlooking Jaigarh Fort and Amer town from the seating area right behind the cafe.\r\n\r\nThe best place to enjoy your coffee is with this view? The outdoor seating area in Cafe Coffee Day.\r\nPlaces to eat near Amer Fort\r\nSadly, there aren’t many good options to eat near Amer Fort. There’s a Cafe Coffee Day outlet near Elephant stand, Stag cafe, and a few local Dhabas on the main road but none of them are worth talking about.\r\n\r\nIf you are fine with eating at a local Dhaba you can try Jagdamba Dhaba on the Amer road opposite to Dilaram Bagh entrance. This Dhaba still uses old-age methods of cooking on a coal oven. The food is neither very spicy nor greasy, unlike most Dhabas. It is a pocket-friendly place. It serves North Indian food only. Jagdamba has been recommended in some of the best travel guides on Jaipur like Jaipur Love by Fiona Caulfield.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed reading this post, don’t forget to share it on your social media.\r\nFollow me on  Facebook      Twitter     Instagram    \r\nWhen to avoid visiting Amer Fort?\r\nAmer Fort is a popular attraction that attracts a large number of visitors and can get extremely crowded at times. It is best not to visit for a long weekend. Also, it can be very crowded during Navratras because of the large number of devotees visiting the Sheela Mata temple. At times, tourist entry to Amer Fort is also closed because of the rush.\r\n\r\nThe Great Wall Of Amer Fort\r\nIf you are keen to read more on Amer Fort history and Amer fort walls, you can refer to an additional resource in Why the loss of the great wall of Amer Fort is inevitable?\r\nHere are a few pictures from this post.\r\n\r\nThe Great Wall Of Amer was meant to provide protection to the Amber Fort & Palace from the enemies.\r\nThe beauty of Amer Fort cannot be described in words or pictures. You’ve got to experience it in person. Many travelers find Amer Fort as the best that the Pink City can offer. While some are in awe with the architecture of Amer Fort, others love its beautiful setting with commanding views of the valley. Everyone has their own reasons. Likewise, you have to find your own.'),

It has several places that manifest the beauty of nature. From hilly, snowy regions to the desert regions, India gives the best places and experiences for its tourists. In India one of the most sought after tourist destination, Rajasthan. This place is one of the best places to visit, as it gives you one of the most authentic experiences that give out the traditional beauty of India.

Now let us look at the Hawa Mahal in Jaipur.\r\n \r\nHawa Mahal:\r\nOne of the most Iconic Monuments of Rajasthan, The Hawa Mahal is over 200 years old. One of the most exciting things about this monument is that all you see are windows. Built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the ruler of Kachhwaha Rajput, the year of its birth is 1799. This is a fusion of Islamic, Mughal and Rajput architectural styles. Complimenting these, the lavish arches and the filigree work in the stones represent the Islamic style of architecture. It is one of its kind pyramid structure, a 5-storeyed building which also represents a pattern of a Beehive. The best time to visit the Mahal is during the sunrise and the sunset as the golden rays lights up the red and pink sandstone building which is spectacular to view.\r\n \r\nInteresting facts on the Hawa Mahal\r\nThis palace was a summer retreat for the Rajput families during the olden times as there is excellent cross ventilation of air. this is due to the prevalence of 953 windows in the building.\r\nBuilt for the Royal ladies of Rajputs, the women would see the life of the common people through the windows.\r\nThe facade is designed in a honeycomb structure. This is for the Royal ladies to watch the daily buzz of the city while the people can’t.\r\nBuilt as a part of the Royal palace, the Mahal has no front entrance. One has to enter the Mahal through the side entrance.\r\nThere are no stairs to reach the top floor. Instead, ramps were used. This was to not compromise on the architecture of the building.\r\n\r\nTimings and Tickets\r\nThis 50 metres high monument is one of the must-visit places in Rajasthan. So as to be accessible, this Mahal is open every day for the public to access. That is one of the best things about this Monument.\r\nTime: (All Day)\r\n9:30 AM – 4:30 PM\r\nThe entry fee to the monument is also not very expensive. The entry fee collected per person for Indian citizens is 50 INR. For foreign tourists, the Mahal charges an entry fee of 200 INR per person.\r\n \r\nJaipur is one of the best tourist locations in India.

(39, 'Leh and Ladakh ', 'https://images.memphistours.com/large/300049555_Leh-Ladakh.jpg', 'Ladakh – where heaven meets the Earth\r\nThe air-hostess announced that we were approaching Leh airport and the captain had turned on the fasten seat-belt sign. As I eagerly peered out of the little aircraft window I catch a glimpse of a vast, barren desert, and posing meekly in its midst a tiny landing-strip. My throat went dry for a moment. The Ladakh adventure had truly begun.\r\n\r\nPangong Lake\r\nLocated in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the humble land of Ladakh in India is cradled by the ice-capped Kunlun mountain range in the north and the Great Himalayas to the south, providing a breathtaking panoramic view all around.\r\nDue to extreme weather conditions which see temperatures plummet to minus 35 degree Celsius, the area remains scarcely populated, resulting in a clean and pristine environment. Once you land in Ladakh, you feel miles away from home; you could be at the very gates of heaven. Clear blue skies, wide landscapes of cold desert, ice-capped mountains and the soft cold mountain breeze against your skin makes you feel cradled in nature’s arms.\r\n\r\nHemis Monastry\r\nLadakh is well known as the ‘Land of the Gompas’ (or monasteries). Historically the region is of Tibetan descent and host to many Buddhist monasteries. Most famed are Thiksay, Hemis, Shey and Dhankar.

At these altitudes temperature extremities are intense. The best time to visit is in summer between June and October when the temperature is at its most pleasant. November invites heavy snowfall and temperatures drop drastically to negatives.\r\nHealth: Due to its high geographical altitude, oxygen levels are low. Initially you might find yourself breathing a little heavier than usual and its advised that you give your body time to acclimatise before setting out on any physical activity. There is a local hospital in Leh if the need arises and you feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nLocal housing\r\nPlaces to stay: There are  a number of options for accommodation in Leh, Ladakh.

(40, 'Manali', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Manali_City.jpg', '            Hidimba Temple\r\nManali, a much popular tourist destination is in the state of Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 2,050 metres above sea level.\r\nThe perfect getaway from a scorching summer in the rest of the country, it is popular among families and honeymooners who want to experience the crispy cool air that envelops the majestic mountains. Sightseeing in Manali can take you to interesting places associated with history, traditions and culture.\r\nFor a glimpse of the local culture in Manali, there’s no better way to begin than with a visit to the Hidimba Temple. At a secluded location amidst a thickly wooded pine tree forest, the temple is named after the famous demon from the epic Mahabharat, Hidimba. Locally referred to as Hidimba Devi Temple, or Hadimba or the Dhungiri Temple, it is one of the most culturally significant places to visit in Manali. This little tourist attraction has risen to so such prominence over the years that tourists believe their sightseeing in Manali is incomplete without a visit to the Hidimba Devi Temple.\r\nMythological Background - The Demon Deity\r\nHer name brought chills down many a spine, for Hidimba was a ferocious demon who ruled the area around the Hidimba Devi Temple. She, along with her brother created havoc in the surrounding villages. People lived in absolute fear during her reign. As the legend goes, the Pandavas were passing by this region and the mighty Bheema among the Pandava brothers spotted Hidimba and fell in love with her. After slaying her brother, he married Hidimba and lived with her around this region in Manali for a year. During this time, Hidimba gave birth to their son Ghatotkach. Bheema then left and proceeded to join his brothers while Hidimba stayed back and nurtured their son till adulthood. Once Ghatotkach became an adult, she left for the higher summits in the Himalayas and turned to a life of penance and repentance for her sins. She worshipped Goddess Durga with such devotion that she could transform herself from her former demon self into a deity.\r\nToday, the deity Hidimba, known locally as the avatar of Goddess Durga is worshipped at the Hidimba Devi Temple. There is also a temple outside dedicated to Ghatotkach. The surrounding lush splendour is another reason for the temple to be among the best places to visit in Manali.\r\nUnique Temple Structure:\r\nNestled in the thickly wooded Dhungiri cedar forest, therefore the name Dhungiri Temple, as the locals call it, the Hidimba Devi Temple built primarily of wood and some mud and stone is like none other. There are four storeys, each attributing a conical shape that the temple eventually assumes as it reaches upwards, and leads to a 24 metre-tower above them all. The doors feature intricate carvings depicting various stories of the Mahabharat, about the main character, Lord Krishna, and other deities. The temple has exquisite carvings etched in stone and placed firmly over mud walls that have stood the test of time. The Hidimba Devi Temple, dedicated to the local deity Hidimba was built by Raja Bahadur Singh in 1553. History and archaeology enthusiasts and religious people consider the Hidimba Devi Temple as one of the most important places to visit in Manali.\r\nThe temple, including the inner sanctum, is devoid of any idol except giant footprints in stone representing the Goddess Hidimba.\r\nCultural Significance\r\nHidimba is considered the mountain deity, and the local people revere her immensely. They seek her grace and blessings before any important occasion and always offer prayers to appease her if the surrounding villages face calamities or any hindrance. The rituals here are unlike any other place. It is sometimes fierce and intense even.\r\nFor some deeper cultural immersion around the temple, visit during the annual festival, when people from surrounding villages bring their deities, all decorated in vermilion and gleaming pieces of cloth to the Hidimba Devi Temple. People partake in rituals, dances and other cultural activities. Delicious local food can be relished here during the festival. Drum beats and trumpets electrify the atmosphere. The Himalayan mountains reaching up to the skies add to the mystic beauty unleashed in total grandeur at the temple.\r\n \r\n\r\nSightseeing in Manali can get more colourful than you can imagine. At the annual festival, the Himachal folk dance of Nati or Kullu Nati is performed at the Hidimba Devi Temple. A performance, while not within the Hidimba Devi Temple was entered in the Guinness Book of Records, as the largest folk dance with over 9000 women taking part. It’s definitely interesting to watch this dance form as locals show up in traditional attires of ghagras, and cholis. Traditional silver and gold jewellery complement the costumes while ornate fans and handkerchiefs complete the look.\r\nQuick Facts:\r\n1. Apart from the annual festival, even during the rest of the year, the Hidamba Devi Temple is a haven of peace. The vibes are calming and the sight is beautiful to behold. Winters present an even better sight and the peace is overwhelming among the snow-capped peaks.\r\n2. Timings: 8 AM to 6 PM\r\n3. The Hidamba Devi Temple is a two-kilometre walk from the Joginder Nagar Railway Station. However, remember to wear appropriate shoes, preferably ones you can trek in, as the route is slightly slippery. Normal slippers or heels are definitely not recommended.\r\n4. The nearest airport is the Kullu Manali Airport at Bhuntar, 52.2 kilometres away from the Hidimba Devi Temple. You can hire a cab from the airport to reach the temple. The car ride would take about 2-2.5 hours.\r\n5. Other attractions at the temple include taking pictures with local animals like fluffy goats and bunnies that children might enjoy.\r\nThere is much to explore among the many historically relevant and tourist places to visit in Manali, besides this famous temple. To take a leisurely tour around the places to visit in Manali, book a stay in a comfortable hotel. Sightseeing in Manali with your family is a fantastic experience.

Or do you want to visit Munsiyari in Kumaon on your next Himalayan adventure? This Munsiyari travel guide will address all of your queries regarding arranging a great Kumaon vacation.\r\nMunsiyari is one of the most beautiful locations in India, located in the Kumaon highlands of Uttarakhand. It’s the most beautiful spot I’ve ever seen, and the enticing valley encircled by snow-capped Himalayan peaks is something everyone should see at least once in their lives.\r\nThere’s a reason Munsiyari sits at the top of our list of unusual locations in Kumaon – Uttarakhand. Getting to such areas is indeed tough, but it is also equally fruitful. The scenery is stunning, there is peace and quiet everywhere, and the people are friendly.\r\nMunsiyari, located in a rural region of Uttarakhand, is widely renowned for its quaintness and sunset-sunrise views from Panchchulli Peaks. It has the greatest views of the five sister peaks of the Himalayas and is easily accessible by road. Apart from providing an out-of-the-way experience away from the crowds, Munsiyari is the starting point for several Himalayan treks. As a result, it is also known as a trekker’s heaven.\r\n \r\nMunsiyari provides several different difficulty level hikes, whether you are a beginner or an experienced trekker.\r\nSo, if you want to see golden Himalayan dawn or sunset from the balcony of your hotel, pack your luggage and head to Munsiyari. Similarly, whether you enjoy walking, climbing, or camping, you will be pleasantly pleased by the attractiveness of this small village in Kumaon.\r\nMunsiyari’s Mythology\r\nThe Panchachuli range is made up of five snow-capped Himalayan peaks. ‘Panchachuli’ is derived from two Hindi words: ‘Pancha’ (five) and ‘Chuli’ (chimney).\r\nAccording to mythology, the five peaks represent the five cooking hearths (chuli) of the five Pandav brothers, who cooked their last supper on these peaks before ascending to heaven, thus the name “Panchachuli.”\r\nAnother idea is that this region was originally part of the old Nepal Kingdom. Because ‘Pancha’ means five and ‘Chuli’ means peaks in Nepalese, the five peaks were named Panchachuli.\r\nMunsiyari’s History\r\nThe Indo-Tibetan border was closed as a result of the Sino-Indian War in 1962. As a result, the prosperous lifeblood of the Bhotiyas, whose major employment was trade with the Tibetans, came to an end.\r\nThe loss of commerce caused significant changes in the transhumant (seasonal movement of humans and animals between fixed summer and winter pastures) way of life.\r\nSince then, the Bhotiya tribes have mostly had semi-agrarian and semi-nomadic lives.\r\nFolklore\r\n\r\nAccording to legend, the Johar valley was formerly inhabited by enormous serpents known as ‘Nagas.’ All but one of the serpents were martyred by the Garuda, a bird who serves as Lord Vishnu’s mount an emblem!\r\nGaruda was killed by an emissary of Shaukya Lama before it could slay the last Naga. The enlightened guru, taken by the beauty of the location, decided to make the valley his home.\r\nAs a result, the Shaukya tribe arose and continues to inhabit the area.\r\nLocation\r\nMunsiyari is located in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand and has a height of roughly 7,590 feet or 2300 meters. It is located on Tibet’s old trade route and serves as the gateway to the Johar Valley. The views of snow-capped Himalayan peaks are the highlight of this unusual Uttarakhand destination.\r\nIt is also known as ‘Little Kashmir.’ From here, one can view the beautiful ranges of the ‘Panchachuli Peaks,’ a collection of five peaks and one of Munsiyari’s most prominent tourist attractions.\r\nWhen is the best time to visit Munsiyari?\r\nMunsiyari, with its stunning vistas and wonderful weather, is a year-round destination. Munsiyari is best visited between March and June and from mid-September until the end of October.\r\nThis time of year is also great for hiking to neighboring glaciers.\r\nSpring and summer – During the spring and summer months (March to early June), the days are extremely nice in Munsiyari, and light woolens will suffice at night. It’s strange to wander through rhododendron forests in bloom.\r\nSummers provide uninterrupted views of Rambha, Shiplakot, Nandakot, Nandaghungti, and Panchachuli peaks. This is most likely the ideal time to visit Munsiyari.\r\nMonsoon – The monsoon season in Munsiyari is quite interesting. The minute you decide to soak up the rays of the sun, your intentions may be derailed by the appearance of rain clouds in the sky.\r\nMonsoon season is not the ideal time to visit because of severe rainfall and landslides, making transport and sightseeing difficult, not to mention the unpleasant arrival of bloodsucking leeches.\r\n\r\nWinter is Coming — Whether you’re a ‘Game of Thrones’ lover or not, you’ll undoubtedly like the snow-covered hamlets of Munsiyari. To defend oneself from the stinging cold, wear heavy woolen clothes.\r\nMunsiyari tourist attractions\r\nMunsiyari is located in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district. The wonderful thing about Munsiyari is that you may visit at any time of year. Throughout the year, the town is very lovely. The majority of this tiny hill station, located at an elevation of 2300 meters, is blanketed with snow. Munsiyari, also known as the “Mini Kashmir of Uttarakhand,” entices travelers with breathtaking mountains, waterfalls, lush vegetation, and adventurous trekking paths.\r\nIf you enjoy trekking or other outdoor activities, Munsiyari is the place to be. This tiny heaven in Uttarakhand is also well-known for its diverse flora and wildlife. Here are some of the most important things to see and do in Munsiyari.\r\nPanchachuli Peaks\r\n\r\nThe Panchchuli peaks are five snow-capped Himalayan peaks located in the eastern end of the Kumaon area, near Munsiyari, in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district.\r\nThe Panchachuli peaks are the most visible from several Kumaon hill stations. You may see a stunning sunrise in the morning and sometimes a magnificent moonrise shortly after dusk from Munsiyari.\r\nThe Birthi Falls\r\n\r\nA 35-kilometer trip from Munsiyari will take you to the Birthi Falls, the natural beauty of this town. Birthi Falls will be seen on your approach to town, but you should schedule a 2-3 hour visit to this incredibly lovely spot to unwind and spend some calm time. Birthi Falls is a popular picnic site in Kumaon for both residents and visitors.\r\nThe waterfall location may be reached through a hiking trail. The trip to Birthi Falls is loaded with adventure and enjoyment for trekkers. Because there is no railing, the journey is extremely breathtaking. Another draw to this area is the distinct array of butterflies and sparrows that flutter around.\r\nKalamuni Top\r\nKalamuni top is another tourist attraction that may be visited on the route to Munsiyari. This tiny village is 14 kilometers from Munsiyari and is located at the height of 9,600 feet above sea level. The location is particularly well-known for its spiritual and religious beauty, which includes an old temple.\r\nLocals and Hindu visitors frequently visit Kalamuni top to pray to the temple’s primary deity, “Goddess Kali.” This location is well-known for Panchachuli Mountain, in addition to its religious attractiveness.\r\nThamri Kund\r\nThamri Kund is the place to go if you’re looking for a revitalizing and refreshing lake in the Kumaon region. To get to this Lake, you’ll have to take an exciting hiking route through a deep and lovely forest. Because the walk from the major town takes 7-8 hours, you should start early in the morning. After hours of wandering and touring, it feels great to rest and relax for a bit when you get to your destination.\r\nThamri Kund is bordered by dense alpine forests, which adds to the overall beauty of the location. Bring your camera so you may capture the magnificence of the beautiful Lake. A musk deer may also be seen wandering around the Lake and sipping from the crystal pure water.\r\nMadkot\r\nMadkot, located 5 kilometers from Munsiyari, is well-known for its hot water springs. The hot water that emerges from Madkot is said to have miraculous healing properties. Locals think that the hot spring may treat skin issues, rheumatism, bodily pains, and other medical conditions.\r\nAlso Read, Auli: Your best Skiing expedition in India\r\nMunsiyar, Pithoragarh Food\r\nMunsiyari’s food is inexpensive. Local street vendors/Dhabas usually provide wonderful Indian and Kumaoni cuisines, with a lunch for one costing between Rs. 80 and Rs. 150. Basic restaurants serve Indian, Chinese, continental, and Kumaoni food, and a dinner for one might range from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. To be on the safe side, stick to local food; it’s locally farmed, so it’s fresher, healthier, and, of course, less expensive.\r\n\r\nChutney made with Bhang.\r\nTry the rustic flavor of “bhang ki chutney,” a traditional Kumaoni side dish. This tangy-sweet chutney is created with roasted Bhang (Hemp Seeds) and jeera (cumin seeds), as well as Pudina leaves and lemon juice.\r\nUnlike the plant from which they originate, Hemp Seeds are not psychotropic. They are an important pantry staple in Kumaoni kitchens.\r\nI highly recommend the sweet and tart Bhuransh drink (Rhododendron flower juice) prepared locally by Maati women and sold at the Sanghthan office in Sarmoli. It has a lot of sugar in it, but it’s really refreshing.\r\n\r\n'),
(44, 'Munsiyari', 'https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bbe1c584a7d5bdec5e4bbc74091a79a4453387/07957/images/package/munsyari/m4.jpg', 'Mirthless in Munsiyari\r\nMunsiyari is a place that I had been avoiding for a long time, mainly because of the sheer distance. A standalone trip only to Munsiyari was never considered because that would have been too time consuming but this time I was finally in Kumaon region for a long time, without any definite plan and more than a month ahead of me.\r\nChampawat was a surprise and after that I quickly reached Pithoragarh. But the flu (or whatever that was) worsened and I got stuck in Pithoragarh for a few days, taking medication and hoping to recover. The Holi was spent there in a frustrating manner, without achieving anything. After that, I finally felt a bit better, and one morning found a shared car to Munsiyari. Buses are not very frequent in these routes and shared cars cost more than buses but I had no option.\r\nWe reached a place called Thal after a few hours. It is a small settlement, but an important meeting point of various routes. This is where I realized that my car only intended to come till here although he promised me Munsiyari. I had to shift to another car and resume the journey. The next stretch was as slow but the altitude increased and views got better. We passed through a stretch of Rhododendrons, mostly pink ones, just before reaching the town. I made mental plans to return to this spot later on. I also came accross a man enjoying siesta under a blooming cherry, peach or apricot tree. Somehow he reminded me of myself. Not sure why.\r\n \r\nAs we reached Munsiyari, the weather was beginning to deteriorate. I wanted to quickly get into a hotel, there were a too many around the bus stand. It was still the off-season and the town had a sleepy look and most hotels seemed empty and desperate for customers. I walked into one but I started regretting it because it looked too fancy for my budget. They quoted INR 1000, I walked out saying it is beyond my limits. But the manager asked what my budget was. I said 500 and he agreed immediately because I was the first customer of the season. I should have said 300.\r\nAfter settling down at the room, I went out to have a walk but the weather had deteriorated even more. A light drizzle had started, it was bitterly cold, but more importantly, all the peaks on the horizon had been obscured by dark clouds. I decided to quickly visit one of the main attractions in town before it is too dark. After talking to a few locals, I zeroed in on the Nanda Devi Temple.\r\nIt is around 3 KMs away from town. After a bit of confusion I found the way and started walking briskly. Now, Nanda Devi practically rules the skyline throughout the northernmost areas of Uttarakhand. I have been to the higher areas of Garhwal, visited Valley of Flowers, which is a part of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, but on Kumaon side, it was the first time I had come that far. Regulars of high Himalayas know that Goddess Nanda Devi is not easy to please. Many acclaimed mountaineers have found it out the hard way. I am never even going to try that but even a mere view of the peak was also elusive, indicating that she was not happy anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nI reached the temple after half an hour. It is a small shrine on the edge of a cliff, offering a great view of the slopes and apparently also of the peaks but I had to do with my imagination for the later part. The shrine itself is a small one. It must have been an ancient site but the temple looked freshly painted, that too with some peculiar Ganesha imagery that points to a more occultist past. The sheer veneration of Nanda Devi is something I find deeply fascinating. I don’t think she finds mention in the major religious texts but in this region she rules everything and is considered a consort of Shiva. There are many other shrines dedicated to her in the higher mountains. It is hard to answer. I found this article online that discusses the Nanda Devi mythology in detail but it also raises more questions than answers. I returned from there without much satisfaction and that night it rained heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, I originally planned to go for the trek to Khaliya top, the best known day trek near Munsiyari. However, the weather was even worse. It was bitterly cold and more importantly, none of the peaks were visible. I spent an hour or so, thinking about it, and then eventually decided to give up on the plan, have a slow breakfast, and then figure out what to do.\r\nThe rain had subsided by 10 am although the horizon was not clear yet and I had already lost my momentum to revisit the hiking plan. So, I started walking around the town for no particular reason. There are several villages near Munsiyari that are popular among visitors. The routes leading to them can be confusing for a first timer. I can’t exactly explain which routes I took but after an hour of walk, I found myself in the outskirts of the town, with a milestone leading towards Darkot village. Some of the peaks had become slightly visible I could even see a blooming rhododendron that contrasted well with the mustard yellow on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was briefly entertaining the idea of walking all the way to Darkot and then find a lift back to town later on. However, the sunshine did not last long. The drizzle returned again as I reached a house with a lemon tree laden with fruits. The lemons in Uttarakhand are indeed gigantic, bigger than mangoes. One can only take so many literal and figurative lemons in one day. So, I decided to give up the long walk too and decided to find the museum that was supposed to be within the town itself.\r\nLocating the museum was not easy. It is just another of those local homes, that is hard to spot from a distance. Although Munsiyari has a small population, the houses are spread all over the hills. The museum is a few Kms away from the main market and takes a bit of effort to find. My first attempts to locate it were not very successful. Locals told me to keep going ahead, but I was not sure if it was that far. However, later on, I accidentally arrived there from the opposite side. I am not sure how that happened but who cares till the goal is achieved?\r\n\r\nThe Tribal Museum in Munsiyari is actually a private collection rather than an official one. It is the result of one man’s perseverance, Dr Sher Singh Pangti, a local scholar who dedicated his life to document and preserve local culture and traditions. There are scores of artefacts, used by local Bhotia population, stored here. Some of these instruments are no longer used in the modern era but they have been stored here with care. Also, it was good to see that they have taken the effort to properly document everything and have published many booklets including travel and trekking guides, and more serious literature about local culture. One can also buy those books from the museum.\r\nI spent a couple of hours at the museum, bought one of the books, and came back. The weather looked slightly better and I got a few landscapes, featuring some unsuspecting locals. Nothing more could be done that day and it rained even more heavily that night. I had other things in mind so I decided to get out of Munsiyari the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\nI woke up to a brighter day but realized that persistent rains had caused snowfall at night in the higher areas. Although there was no snow in town, I could see that all the nearby hills had turned white. Only if I had stayed another day, I could have done something more exciting. But I had some deadlines and the lack of data connectivity in Munsiyari made it impossible for me to stay for one more day. While coming back, I noticed that the Rhododendron stretch that I mentioned earlier, was completely covered in snow. Sadly, the driver did not care about any of that and passed through the area very fast. I was also sitting in the middle of the car, and could not get a single photograph. This was a great miss and it kept haunting me for a few weeks, till I managed to get even better views of the same in Chopta.\r\n\r\n\r\nMunsiyari Travel Guide\r\nHow to Reach Munsiyari?\r\nIdeally you can reach Munsiyari from Pithoragarh via two routes, via Thal and via Jauljibhi and Madkot. Both routes are around 130 Kms. Pithoragarh can be reached easily from Haldwani-Almora or Tanakpur-Champawat route.\r\nThe bus service to Munsiyari is not very satisfactory. I barely saw one or two buses during my stay and I am sure you will not get one when you need. The only option here is shared cars. However, they charge more than the bus and also they keep waiting indefinitely till they find enough passengers to fill the vehicle with 50% more people than the number of seats available.\r\nWhere to Stay in Munsiyari?\r\nThere are plenty of hotels and resorts in Munsiyari. I found them to be cheap but it was the off-season. It will probably be harder in the summer.\r\nWhat to do and see in Munsiyari?\r\nMunsiyari is the base to some of the major treks. Milam, Ralam, and Namik glaciers have been favourites among serious trekkers for a long time. There are local hikes like Khaliya Top and Thamri Kund. You will come accross a waterfall at Birthi even before reaching Munsiyari.\r\nVillages near Munsiyari have various attractions. Darkot is known for is weavers while Mudkot has a hot water spring with healing properties. Near the town, do pay a visit to the msueum and the Nanda Devi temple.\r\nHow is phone and data connectivity in Munsiyari?\r\nMy BSNL data stopped working after Pithoragarh although I could make calls. I think other services perform better. Also, there should be a cyber cafe or two in town in case you need.\r\n\r\n'),

It provides an irreplaceable offer of catching a bird’s eye view of the breath-taking Naini Lake and the entire Nainital hill station. A treat for the senses, relax as you glide across the air over such pristine landscapes.\r\nPicnic by the Waterfall\r\n\r\nPicnic by Waterfall\r\nPull up a bit of rock and grass as you settle down for a rejuvenating lunch amidst the cascading waters of the waterfalls in Mukteshwar. Complete with the open valley views and unmatched serenity, this will come as a welcome break from the unending buzz which is the chaotic city life.\r\nPlanetarium Visit\r\n\r\nPlanetarium\r\nDrop in for a spot of the stargazing at the Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences for an otherworldly experience. Lose yourself in the stars and beyond as you delve deep into the majestic unknown of the universe and its underlying mysteries.\r\nSunset at Hanuman Garhi Temple\r\n\r\nHanuman Garhi Temple\r\nA famous temple in the honour of Lord Hanuman, who is a much celebrated image of unwavering devotion himself, being one of the greatest worshippers of Lord Ram. Perched at an altitude of 6400ft above sea level, the whole case of divinity is multiplied by the sun making its gorgeous descent beyond the mountains silhouetting the statue of Hanuman, its palm open in blessing.\r\nBest time to visit Nainital\r\nMarch to June is the popular tourist season when the weather is perfect for outdoor activities and quite pleasant. If you’re the type to lace up your adventure boots, this is the time to visit here with paragliding, trekking, camping and rafting all up for grabs.\r\nJuly to September sees heavy rainfall and quite a drop in visitors. On the up side the rains make the hills more luxuriant and if you’re the kind who prefers dripping weather and lonesome hikes, this time has your name all over it.\r\nOctober to February gets chilly and January brings in snowfall too.\r\nAlthough Nainital is a year-round destination, the activities open to you may vary based on when you visit. So, plan accordingly.\r\nThings to carry\r\nPack as light as possible given the amount of road travel involved here.\r\n• Cotton clothing for summer and a light jacket would work for when evenings get cooler. If you’re un[travel]ling in winter, warmer clothes complete with thick socks and warmer jackets. Carry your windcheater and umbrella if you’re here in the monsoons as well.\r\n• Sturdy walking shoes, mandatory if you’re hiking, make sense given the amount of walking involved here.\r\n• Sunscreen, especially if you’re going up to the higher reaches. Usual prescription medications.\r\n• Mobile and tablet electronic chargers.\r\nBest places to stay\r\n• Manu Maharani, Nainital\r\n• The Naini Retreat, Nainital\r\n• Shervani Hilltop, Nainital\r\n• The Pavillion, Nainital\r\n• Balrampur House, Nainital\r\n\r\n'),

On a dreary weekend in August, without any previous plan, Neel and I set off for a weekend trip. Being budget travellers, we always avail the public transport safely keeping in mind the inconveniences of taking a much longer time than a drop off by car. On a Friday evening, we went to Mysore from Bangalore by bus which took us almost five and a half hours. One can go to Coorg, Ooty, Wayanad and ample other places from Mysore. One can also spend a day or two in Mysore also, a historical town itself.\r\nBeginning of a Soulful Journey to Ooty\r\n\r\nIn my utter confusion of which hill station to visit, Neel suggested we take a bus to Ooty, another five and a half hour of journey. So we started, sitting in the cabin of the driver, having a clear view of the front, not compromising any side of the road. Just after 15 mins of the start of our journey, we came across the Chamundi hills and a number of lakes above which we could point out the cormorants and the ibis. The weather was pleasant with the sun and the clouds playing hide-and-seek and also one or two bouts of drizzles. The Mysore-Ooty highway turns adventurous once it crosses Gundulpet. After this, starts the Bandipur Tiger Reserve maintained by the state of Karnataka which continues as the Mudhumalai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu. One can easily see herd of deer, peafowls and wildboars on the wayside. One may also come across the tuskers and various colourful birds if cautious. And if one is lucky enough, the big cat may also be sighted who keeps an eye on the busy highway from the shrubs!!!\r\nAfter the Mudhumalai Tiger Reserve, the road takes you through the misty, meandering paths over the hills, green coffee and tea plantations to the Queen of Hills in the Nilgiris. In the Nilgiris on your way, you come across the shrubs of the Nilakurinji flowers. These flowers bloom once in twelve years and many people in the villages keep account of their ages by the blooming of these purplish-blue flowers. These are the flowers which turn the hills into a mesmerising blue thus explaining the name, The Nilgiris. Currently, these flowers are not seen much in Ooty as they have been destroyed by the widely flourishing tea plantations. The last stretch of the road from Guddalur to Ooty offers the most breathtaking views. At times the route traverses through the dense pine forests allowing glimpses of sunlight through the trees or at other times it passes through the thick bamboo woods. The presence of small lakes and waterfalls amidst the landscape only reminds you of God’s bounty. Through this splendid road among nature, one becomes spellbound when he/she reaches Udagamandalam or Kovai, a tinsel town surrounded on all sides by the Nilgiris and the blue toy train chugging through it.\r\nOoty at Last\r\n\r\nSo! We have reached Ooty, one of the famous tourist places for the honeymooners; the hill station about which we heard for the umpteenth time since childhood; the shooting spot for so many movies; the hill station harbouring the highest peak in Tamil Nadu. We simply liked to walk about its busy as well as quiet thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n');

Having been there 4 times already, we are still surprised to discover a new side of Ooty with every trip we do here. After our most recent trip to Ooty this time, we decided to pen down for our readers a perfect 5 days Ooty trip itinerary. This 5 days Ooty trip itinerary will include not only the usual touristy places to see in Ooty. But many others beyond them, which we have actually discovered on multiple trips that we have made to Ooty so far. Obviously this 5 days Ooty trip itinerary is not the one that we have followed. But, if we were to combine all our 4 Ooty trips together and come up with one plan, this would be the itinerary for us. Having said that, let me delve right into the itinerary.\r\nI hope that this 5 days Ooty trip itinerary will have something for everyone. If you are a nature lover and want to stay far from the hustle and bustle of the main town, feel free to use the parts of the itinerary which are more suited for you. On the other hand, if you want to stay in the main town and visit it’s attractions, feel free to do so. Basically, if you don’t have 5 consecutive days at hand or if all the parts of this itinerary don’t suite you, feel free to customise it for your needs. By dropping few days or activities here and there. Before delving into the itinerary, let me give a brief overview of Ooty. And other important things required to plan your 5 days Ooty trip itinerary.\r\nTable of Contents\r\nHow to reach Ooty\r\nWhat is the best time to visit Ooty\r\nWhere to stay in Ooty\r\n5 days Ooty trip Itinerary\r\nDay 1: Arrival in Ooty & some sightseeing on the way\r\nDay 2: Ooty town sightseeing\r\nOoty Lake\r\nDodabetta Peak\r\nBotanical Garden Ooty\r\nDeer Park Ooty\r\nToda Tribe Huts\r\nRose Garden Ooty\r\nDay 3: A half day tour of Coonoor & Toy Train Ride\r\nTea Garden, Coonoor\r\nSims Park\r\nDolphin’s Nose\r\nLamb’s Rock\r\nDay 4: Drive to Avalanche Lake & Emerald Lake from Ooty town\r\nDay 5: Drive back from Ooty\r\nTips on doing the 5 days Ooty trip itinerary\r\nHow to reach Ooty\r\nFrom most of the major cities around including Bangalore, Mysore and Coimbatore, regular buses ply to Ooty. One can also drive down to Ooty from these cities and towns. If using train, one can go upto Coimbatore which is the nearest town. And then take a bus or taxi from there to Ooty. Also, one can hire a taxi or drive down on their own. On our trips to Ooty from Bangalore, we have used overnight bus, hired a taxi and also drove on our own. The nearest airport is Coimbatore. So, one can also fly in there and then reach Ooty from there.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to visit Ooty\r\nTo be honest, Ooty is a year round destination. I myself have visited Ooty during the monsoons in the month of August. And then in summer in the month of April. My next two trips to Ooty were in February and January respectively. And I enjoyed my visit to Ooty in all these seasons. During the monsoon season, the crowd is least. And most of the attractions are empty. Plus, if you are like me, you are going to thoroughly enjoy the clouds hanging low. Actually, they will literally hug you. There are occasional bouts of rain now and then. But these are not very long spells. So you have to just stay somewhere in a shade for a while when it rains. And then continue on your trip after that.\r\nClouds Hovering Low over the tea garden in Ooty\r\nWhile in the winter months, the sky is clear. And there is warm sunshine in the day. While the air is chilly. So it gets really cold by evening. In fact, on my most recent visit to Ooty one morning we woke up to see the whole meadow covered with a thin layer of ice crystal. Which means the temperature must be dropping to freezing cold during the night at times! So, if you enjoy the winter sunshine and the chilly evenings then visit Ooty between November to February. This season is also not very crowded.\r\nA crisp morning in Ooty during winter season\r\nIn the month of May, the flowers in Nilgiris are in full bloom. There is even a flower festival held in the Botanical Garden of Ooty. The whole valley is fresh and green after bouts of monsoon showers. The days are warm and nights are comfortably cold during this month. But then it is also the peak season. So, you will find a bit of crowd at the usual tourist spots. So, book your accommodation in advance.\r\nWhere to stay in Ooty\r\nWe have stayed at different locations during our stay in Ooty on different occasions. And from our experience, we recommend the following accommodations:\r\nSterling Elk Hills, Ooty – This is located around 4km from the main town. Not very far, yet tucked in a beautiful secluded corner. The rooms have views of the valley. And the icing on the cake is that they have family suites with kitchenette. Which families are sure to enjoy. Apart from that the food is amazing. And so is the hospitality. We particularly loved staying here with our parents and kids because of the suite room, which reminded us of our similar experience while staying in Bangkok, Thailand. Although the kitchenette is equipped with a microwave. And a sink. Plus basic cutlery. I do wish that it had an induction cooktop or a gas cooktop and some basic pots and pans as well. Nevertheless, it is totally worth a short stay. As, it has all other facilities like wifi, strong network and proximity to the town etc.\r\nView from our window in Sterling Elk Hill Ooty\r\n \r\nBook Sterling Elk Hill Ooty here at booking.com\r\nBook Sterling Elk Hill Ooty here at Agoda.com\r\nLa Montana TGI (Previously Sagar Resort), Ooty – This one is special to us. As, this was where we stayed on our first trip. And loved every bit of our stay here. The usp of this place is the big balconies attached to each room. And uninterrupted breathtaking views of the valley from these villas. You can also see the toy train crossing from the valley. Although, it is almost 8km away from the main town. So, if you want to enjoy some peaceful time and beautiful natural views, and don’t mind staying a bit far from the main town, don’t give a second thought to this place. They also have excellent food and service. While staying here, we had hired cab from the hotel for sight seeing. And the charges were very reasonable. Read my complete review of our stay at Hotel Sagar Resort here. \r\nLa Montana Ooty (Previously Sagar Resort Ooty)\r\nBook La Montana Ooty here at Agoda.com\r\nAccord Highland Hotel, Ooty – Hotel Accord Highland is located at a very high altitude, only 3km from Dodabetta Peak, the highest peak in Ooty. Again, it is a bit far from the main town. But it is very conveniently located on the Ooty-Kotagiri Highway. I stayed here on one of the recent visits, just for the mesmerising views of the valley and the Nilgiris mountain ranges from here. The rooms have beautiful views. And there is a big lawn also for kids to play and elders to relax.\r\nAccord Highland Ooty CampusAccord Highland Ooty CampusViews near accord highland ooty\r\nBook Accord Highland Ooty here at booking.com\r\nBook Accord Highland Ooty here at Agoda.com\r\n \r\nDestiny Farmstay Ooty – This one is very far from the main town, almost 28km. But it is a completely different and unique experience. If you are following our 5 days Ooty trip itinerary, we recommend you stay here for one night. I will dedicate a separate blog post to destiny farmstay, emerald lake and the experience that it offers. Along with the description of Emerald Lake – the huge turquoise blue lake . Which is one of the most beautiful lakes I have visited in India. And why staying here at the banks of Emerald Lake at Destiny Farmstay is a very unique experience. We highly recommend staying here for once.\r\n\r\nView from the balcony at Destiny Farmstay\r\n \r\n \r\n5 days Ooty trip Itinerary\r\nThe 5 days Ooty trip Itinerary is carved assuming you drive to Ooty on your own. So, a lot of time on day 1 and day 5 is reserved for driving. If you are taking an overnight bus or other public transport, you might have a little extra time at hand than what I have put in this 5 days Ooty trip itinerary. So, if that is a case, leave me a comment and I will let you know what you can do for your itinerary as per your arrival and departure schedule.\r\nDay 1: Arrival in Ooty & some sightseeing on the way\r\nAssuming you are driving from Bangalore, Mysore or other such city. Start early in the morning. And then drive down via this route:-\r\nBangalore->Mysore->Bandipur->Mudumalai->Gudalur->Ooty\r\n \r\nThis route is around 30km longer than the other route via Masinagudi that google maps shows you by default. But, it is much more scenic, one of the best road trips in India! First of all you get to enjoy spotting the wildlife in Bandipur National Park and the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. We spotted herds of deer freely grazing near the highway, some elephants, peacocks, apes and lots of groups of monkeys on our most recent drive through Bandipur and Mudumalai.\r\nAnimals spotted while crossing Bandipur Tiger ReserveElephant spotted in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve\r\nPlus you can do some sight seeing while on your way to your accommodation. As, it passes through Pykara Lake, 9th mile shooting point and 6th mile. So, if you start by 5:00am in the morning, from Bangalore, you can reach Pykara Lake by 1:30pm. Even after taking ample breaks on the way. It is a beautiful lake surrounded by forests. You can enjoy a boat ride in the lake. And also visit the Pykara Waterfalls right besides the lake.\r\nPykara Lake Ooty\r\nFrom here, you can go to 9th Mile, which is a beautiful green plateau. Perfect to enjoy the scenic green mountains around. It is a perfect spot to have your lunch. Assuming you are carrying it from home or can get it packed on the way. Also, it is a famous shooting place where several scenes from different Bollywood movies are frequently filmed. From 9th mile, proceed further towards the Ooty town. On the way, visit 6th mile. 6th mile is another shooting spot amidst pine forests. You can trek down the mountain slope here, crossing the pine trees. And finally reach on the bank of a scenic lake below. Again, another perfect spot to take some awesome pictures. After all this, you can reach your accommodation in town or near Ooty town by 5:30pm to max 6:00pm.\r\n9th Mile shooting point ooty\r\nActually, we visited these spots on our second trip to Ooty. And the day after arrival in the town. Only to realise that you can cover them right on your way to Ooty!! Thats why we have included these on the first day of this 5 days Ooty trip itinerary.\r\nDay 2: Ooty town sightseeing\r\nIf you have not been to Ooty before, it is totally worth it to visit the lovely tourist attractions spread around the town. The top ones include –\r\nOoty Lake\r\n\r\nA beautiful manmade lake in the centre of Ooty town. You can do boating in the Ooty lake.\r\nOr, cycle around the lake. And shop from the numerous shops around the lake.\r\nDodabetta Peak\r\nThis is the highest peak of Ooty. There is an observation deck here. From where you can see far and wide into the plains beyond the Nilgiris. Also, it is mostly chilling and cold here. Because of the high altitude. It is located around 6km from the centre of the main town.\r\nBotanical Garden Ooty\r\n\r\nOne of the best gardens in India is the botanical garden of Ooty. It includes a huge variety of flora, a glasshouse, a small nursery and vast lawns where one can sit and enjoy nature. This is one spot that I have visited thrice while on my trips to Ooty. Totally love the different shades of green and the different species of plants here.\r\nDeer Park Ooty\r\nLocated almost 2km from Ooty Lake, the deer park is a small wildlife sanctuary right in the heart of Ooty town. Nature and wildlife enthusiasts are very likely to love this place. However, I have personally never been here.\r\n\r\nToda Tribe Huts\r\nThe Toda Tribes in Ooty are mostly farmers and cattle herders. They live in very unique huts. (Which sure will remind you a bit of Hobbiton!). Although I am sure these tribes have never seen Hobitton. So, do visit these huts and drive the parallel yourself while in Ooty.\r\nRose Garden Ooty\r\nThe Rose Garden of Ooty houses 20 thousand varieties of Roses!! They are mostly in full bloom in the month of May. Where a flower show is also held in the garden. The Rose Garden is another beautiful spot to visit in Ooty town.\r\nApart from the above, if time permits, visit a chocolate factory. Here you can see the process of making the famous Ooty chocolates.\r\nDay 3: A half day tour of Coonoor & Toy Train Ride\r\nAfter covering all the Ooty town attractions on the second day of your 5 days Ooty trip itinerary, head for a half day trip to Coonoor from Ooty. Coonoor is another beautiful Nilgiris gem of a place, situated right next to Ooty. Self drive or hire a cab from Ooty, And visit the following attractions in Coonoor.\r\nTea Garden, Coonoor\r\n\r\nCoonoor is famous for it’s tea garden. So, why not visit one on your way there. Many of these tea gardens also have adjoining tea stalls from where you can enjoy freshly brewed tea. And they also have small shops from where you can buy tea leaves. My own memory from my first trip to Ooty is standing in the middle of tea garden. And hugging the monsoon clouds.\r\nSims Park\r\n\r\nWhat Ooty Botanical Garden is to Ooty, Sim’s park is to Coonoor. It is a very beautiful, large, manicured botanical garden that consists of several varieties of plants & trees. Also, it has a beautiful landscape. With flower beds, small ponds and fairytale bridges across those ponds. Do visit here when in Coonoor.\r\nDolphin’s Nose\r\nA viewpoint high up that gives 180 degrees view of the surroundings. On a clear day, you can see as far as the town of Coimbatore from Dolphin’s Nose. Another must visit while in Coonoor. The name is “Dolphin’s Nose” because the viewpoint is pointed at the edge just like a dolphin’s nose ?\r\nLamb’s Rock\r\nThis is a unique rock which you can climb with a short trek involving intermittent stairs. And then you can trek back another path. There is a small view point at the top. And again, you get to see beautiful views of the plains stretching in all directions. And the Nilgiri mountains standing guard around these valleys.\r\nAfter visiting these spots in Coonoor, head to Coonoor railway station. And catch the Coonoor Udagmandalam MG Passenger Toy Train (56138) on your way back to Ooty, At the time of this writing, the train leaves Coonoor around 4:30pm and reaches Ooty railway station by 5:45 pm. Meet your cab here and drive back to your accommodation. The toy train is a heritage train of Nilgiri Mountain Railways. Just like the Toy Train in Shimla & the Darjeeling toy train. It passes through beautiful valleys and mountain terrains. Some of the views that it offers are very picturesque and breathtaking.\r\nDay 4: Drive to Avalanche Lake & Emerald Lake from Ooty town\r\n \r\nWe have reserved the best for the last. For an offbeat experience from the main town of Ooty, visit Avalanche Lake & Emerald lake. These are two huge and beautiful lakes almost 28km from the main town of Ooty. Unspoilt, natural, beautiful! These lakes are located in reserve forest area. And the whole region is called “Silent Valley”. The name is completely justified given the tranquility of this region. They are a must visit. Alas, I didn’t know about them on my first two trip to Ooty. before the third trip, I was looking for something offbeat and beautiful. And that is when I stumbled upon these lakes. Although, I couldn’t plan to stay nearby or spend a good amount of time by these beautiful lakes. But I did return with that burning desire in my heart.\r\n \r\nSo, on my fourth trip, I planned to spend a night at Destiny Farmstay, on the banks of Emerald Lake. And every moment spent here was totally magical. So, we highly recommend you don’t just drive to these lakes, but rather stay somewhere on the banks or near the lakes. So that you can take a walk or a trek alongside these beautiful lakes. Accommodations like Destiny Farmstay even arrange for camping and picnic by the side of the lake. Stay tuned for my writeup on our Destiny Farmstay Experience! \r\nPlease note that although these lakes are situated just 28km from the main Ooty town. But it takes nearly one hour to reach them. Because of the ghat roads and hairpin bends. So, plan accordingly. As you leave the town, and reach the Avalanche area, you get to a viewpoint from where you can see the whole reserve forest and the lake in the middle of it.\r\nView from Avalanche View Point\r\nAfterwards, you can further cross the Emerald Dam. And reach the Emerald lake viewpoint. From where you can catch a wider and closer glimpse of the lake. It really looks like an emerald sea in the middle of the beautiful green mountains. Drive further down and you reach the banks of the Avalanche lake. You can actually get down to the lake from here. And have a picnic by the banks.\r\n \r\nA little further from here, you reach the Destiny Farmstay Parking. So, if you have booked an overnight stay with them, you can park your car here. And then reach the farm stay in their vehicle. As the last 3km to the farm stay is a narrow mud road that most of the regular cars can’t ply. All the rooms in the resort have beautiful view of the lake. And they also arrange for walking and camping by the lake. So, enjoy your overnight stay near the lake here.\r\nDay 5: Drive back from Ooty\r\nToday being the last day of your 5 days Ooty trip itinerary. Post breakfast, checkout from your accommodation. And start your drive back home. Don’t forget to pack your lunch from Ooty town. Because most probably, during lunch time you will be crossing the forests of Mudumalai and Bandipur. Where you can’t find any restaurant. Neither are you allowed to stop your vehicle. If you pack something for lunch from Ooty, you can conveniently stop anywhere on the way and have it on time.\r\nLast but not the least, don’t forget to stop by a chocolate factory outlet on your way back to buy some homemade, mouthwatering Ooty chocolates. Below is a an Ooty Chocolate Factory Outlet location pinned for your reference. We bought chocolates from here on our last two visits to Ooty. They have large variety and reasonable cost. Also, they have Nilgiris tea in different flavour, essential oils, spices and dry fruits as well.\r\nTips on doing the 5 days Ooty trip itinerary\r\nWear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking and trekking on the hills.\r\nNo matter which season you visit Ooty in, the nights get chilly. So, carry one thick jacket for the night time.\r\nCarry more woollen cloths like sweater, cap, muffler when visiting end of December or January and February.\r\nAlso, carry an umbrella when visiting in the rainy season (April – September).\r\nIf you are visiting Ooty during the covid times, you need to e-register at the TN government website and carry a printout of the same. It will be checked at the border while entering Tamil Nadu.\r\nAlso, if you have more days at hand, you can consider staying overnight at Bandipur. It will be a nice break. Plus you can take the safari at Bandipur National Park.\r\nThe town of Ooty is very adequately stocked with all essentials that you need. You can always shop from there for anything and everything while there.\r\n \r\n\r\n'),

The town is also very much near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. One of the most important things about Orchha is that it is included in the UNESCO heritage sites. Orchha State was founded in 1501 AD by the Bundela chief, Rudra Pratap Singh, who became its first king. He ruled the kingdom between 1501-1531.\r\nThe town is although very small but there are many famous and architecturally important monuments to entertain the tourist. There are many tourist places in Orchha.\r\nRam Raja Temple:\r\nIt is the only temple where Lord Ram is worshiped as a king as well as god. Numerous visitors flock to this Orchha temple. The visitor’s number range from fifteen hundred to three thousand especially on certain important Hindu festivals like the Makar Sankranti, Vasant Panchami, Shivratri, Ram Navami, Kartik Purnima.\r\nLaxmi Narayan Temple:\r\nLaxmi Narayan temple is a blend of temples and fort. It is a geometric wonder as the temple is constructed in such a way that it appears rectangular from the outside but is triangular from inside. Also, the temple has an octagonal central tower. The temple’s wall depicts beautiful mythological paintings and stories of the ancient period. There are also paintings depicting British rule! Also, there are some stories of Mahabharat and Ramayana and some of the king’s victories. This place is one of the most visited tourist places in Orchha.\r\nJahangir Mahal:\r\nSince the mahal was built by a Rajput ruler for a Mughal emperor you will get a glimpse of Indo Islamic architectural style. It is a storied building with beautiful hanging balconies. You will see several domes and chhatris adding beauty to the whole structure. A spectacular light and sound show in the evening hours in the Jahangir Mahal will make you well versed with the history of the city of Orchha and the Jahangir Mahal and you will get to be a part of the Orchha history.\r\nChaturbhuj mahal:\r\nChaturbhuj Temple is situated at Orchha in Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu. Chaturbhuj is made from a combination of two words ‘chatur’ and ‘bhuj’ , where ‘chatur’ means “four” and ‘bhuj’ means “arms” which literally translates to “one who has four arms” and refers to Rama an avatar of Vishnu. It is believed that a Bundela Rajput king Madhukar Shah built the temple for his wife, Rani Ganeshkuwari.\r\nFamed Chhatris Of Orchha: Cenotaphs\r\nThere are fourteen ‘Chatris’ or memorials to the rulers of Orchha. There are the 17th and 18th centuries of beautiful cenotaphs. Although the cenotaphs are built in the memory of a Bundela ruler, you will see a glimpse of Mughal architecture. Each Chhatri can be distinguished from each other because of the design. The structures are triple-storied. Four chambers make up a dome-shaped covering surrounded by small cenotaphs resting on columns.\r\nOne should surely visit Orchha if they want to enlighten themselves spiritually. \r\n\r\n'),
(51, 'Orchha', 'https://www.mptourism.com/images/point-of-interest/Chhatris.jpg', 'Jahangir Mahal – Orchha\r\nThere are so many palaces in India that are worth visiting. But do you know that there are many palaces in India that are unique and have their own historical significance? One such fort is the Jahangir mahal. This palace is situated in Orchha. It is a beautiful citadel and also called Mahal-e-Jahangir. This fort has a big importance in Orchha history. The palace also attracts lots of tourists and is one of the famous places of Orchha tourism.\r\nThe Jahangir Mahal is also known as Orchha Palace, Rani Mahal, Jahangir Citadel, Citadel of Jahangir, Mahal-e-Jahangir, etc. Jahangir Mahal is 18 Km away from Jhansi and located on the banks of River Betwa.\r\nHistorical Significance\r\nJahangir Mahal construction can be dated back to the seventeenth century. As the name suggests the palace was built for the reception of Mughal emperor Jahangir. It has a beautiful huge gateway at the entrance for a grand reception of the guest.\r\nArchitecture\r\nThe front wall of the palace is covered with turquoise tiles. It is a three-storied structure which has wonderful balconies, porches, and apartments.\r\nThe mahal comprises large domes. These domes make the palace look more beautiful. Also, the large area in front of mahal has the capacity of accommodating numerous elephants that were kept there for various purposes.\r\nThe Struggle of Orchha kingdom\r\nThis palace has a big role in Orchha history. Jahangir Mahal witnessed the struggle that raja Vir Deo had to go through to protect Orchha from the Mughal invasion. He fought Mughal forces but at last, surrendered and agreed to remain under the Mughal rule. This led to further weakening of the military forces of Orchha and during Jahangir’s succession, he remained fugitive until death.\r\nToday the palace comes under the Archeology department of Madhya Pradesh.  \r\n\r\n'),
(52, 'Orchha', 'https://www.mptourism.com/images/point-of-interest/Chhatris.jpg', '                                ORCHHA, Madhya Pradesh\r\n \r\n \r\nOn the banks of the Betwa River in Madhya Pradesh lies the village of Orchha. Roughly 400 km from Delhi, the village served as the capital of Bundelkhand between the 16th and 18th century. The rulers were a clan of Rajputs friendly with the Mughal emperor Jahangir. Though distinctly Rajput in style, their architecture was also heavily influenced by the Mughals.\r\nToday, Orchha is a chill town centered around the Ram Raja Temple, a temple where Lord Rama is worshipped as a king. Both the town and the surrounding countryside are dotted with forts, temples, and tombs; the area is well worth a day or two of Indian adventuring.\r\nTo help you make the most of your Orchha adventure, here’s a quick guide to travel in Orchha, Madhya Pradesh.\r\n\r\nHow to get to Orchha\r\nTo get to Orchha, you first have to head to Jhansi, a city about 30 minutes from Orchha in Uttar Pradesh.\r\nJhansi is on a major rail line from Delhi; many trains heading further south stop at Jhansi. The train takes only five to six hours, but beware: tickets sell out fast in high season! It’s also possible to get to Jhansi from Bhopal by train, or from Khajuraho via Chhatarpur.\r\nFrom Jhansi, you can get a private rickshaw to Orchha for about 300 Rs. It’s also possible to get a shared rickshaw from Jhansi bus station, which should cost you around 30 Rs. There are shared rickshaws from Jhansi railway station to Jhansi bus station for 10 Rs.\r\nThings to do in Orchha\r\nMost people travel to Orchha to bask amongst the multitudinous palaces and temples. That’s all well and good, but know there’s much more to Orchha than its monuments!\r\n\r\nRoam about the palace area\r\nThe palace area, situated on a small island across from Orccha, is home to two grand palaces: the Raj Mahal and the Jahangir Mahal.\r\nBoth mahals are in great condition, and house plenty of intricate archways, lovingly painted murals, and little lookout spots great for photographic eyes. The island is filled with other smaller temples, havelis, and palaces in varying states of upkeep.\r\n \r\nSee more: if you’re visiting Madhya Pradesh, don’t forget to check out the Bandhavgarh National Park, home of Panpatha Sanctuary and Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. It’s definitely worth the trip\r\nWalking around the grounds of the palace area is free, as is entering most of the buildings. But if you want to enter the Raj Mahal, Jahangir Mahal, and several other sights, you have to buy a ticket.\r\nThere is a combi ticket available for the two palaces, plus several other sites including…\r\nThe camel stables and Rai Praveen Mahal (both in the palace area)\r\nCenotaphs of the Rajput rulers\r\nChaturbhuj Temple\r\nLakshmi Narayan Temple.\r\nThe combi ticket price is 10 Rs for Indians, 250 Rs for foreigners, plus 25 Rs per camera if you have one. The ticket is only valid on the day of purchase.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Raja Mahal\r\nCheck out the view from Chatarbhuj Temple\r\nAnother good reason to travel to Orchha is the magnificent temple dominating Orchha’s skyline.\r\nChatarbhuj was built in the 16th century, and was supposed to house an idol of Lord Rama. The best part: you can climb the narrow stairs to the roof for an incredible view of Orchha and the surrounding countryside.\r\n\r\nGet lost in Ram Raja and the surrounding bazaar\r\nThe Ram Raja temple is situated next tot he Chatarbhuj Temple, and houses a revered idol of Rama.\r\nThe temple and the surrounding bazaar are a hive of activity, with devotees jostling to get a glimpse of the idol, and milk-sweet vendors vying loudly for your rupees. Vivid colors pop in the bazaar, which nevertheless has a chilled out atmosphere by Indian standards.\r\nClose to the temple and further into the bazaar you can find Phool Bagh, a small garden with the tomb of a local hero.\r\n\r\nThe Ram Raja temple is a hive of activity at all times of day\r\nWeave through the Orchha Cenotaphs (Chhatris)\r\nThe tombs for the former rulers of Orchha can be found at the southern end of the town. The main cluster is situated in a calm Mughal style garden, offering serenity away from the town. Great place to hang out at sunset. The Orchha Cenopaths are part of the combi-ticket that can be purchased at the entrance of Raj Mahal.\r\n\r\nThe Chattris, or Cenotaphs, make a great sunset spot\r\nClimb to the top of Lakshmi Narayan Temple\r\nImpressive temple on a hill at the eastern edge of town. Offers great views from the roof, to which you can climb, and has well-preserved murals inside. Don’t forget to take off your shoes. Part of the combi-ticket that can be purchased at the entrance of Raj Mahal.\r\n\r\nThis Lakshmi temple can be seen towering over Orchha\r\nDelve into nature (and sites within)\r\nBesides the above mentioned there are plenty of other temples, palaces, and tombs to explore in and around Orchha. Many of these are abandoned or taken over by farmers who, in some cases, have made their home inside the temple. One such example is the Shiv Temple, a bit north of the Palace Area. If you have the time it is worth seeking out some of the further sights, as they offer a slice of tranquility while exploring rural India.\r\n\r\nOne of the many smaller sites scattered around the countryside\r\nAcross from Orchha there is also a nature reserve with several hiking paths. Entry fees are 15 Rs for Indians and 150 Rs for foreigners. If you don’t feel like walking, there are several bike rental shops in town. It is also possible to swim in the river, as the Batwa is one of India’s cleanest rivers. There are also plenty of secluded spots for 420 lovers.\r\nWhere to sleep and eat when traveling to Orchha\r\nOrchha Homestay\r\nOrchha has a wonderful homestay program run by the Friends of Orchha organization.\r\nLocated in the small village of Ganj, 1 km outside of Orchha, Orchha Homestay gives you the opportunity to stay with local villagers. They operate six homestays with a total of nine rooms. The homestays are mostly run by low-caste people who otherwise have difficulty making a living. A single is 750 Rs and a double is 950 Rs. Rooms can be booked online, by email, or by phone.\r\n \r\nOther guest houses and hotels\r\nIf you don’t want this, there are several guesthouses and hotels in Orchha itself.  Temple View Guest House is a solid option (book Temple View Guest House), and so is Hotel Sunset (book Hotel Sunset). Those wishing more luxury can stay at the Sheesh Mahal, a literal palace in the palace area (book Sheesh Mahal Hotel).\r\n\r\nView from one of the rooftop restaurants in Orchha\r\nFood and drinks\r\nOrchha offers the standard variety of temple town food stalls and restaurants serving Indian, Chinese, and Continental food. Many places serve beer off the menu. The restaurant at the Sheesh Mahal offers more fine dining options. If you’re staying at an Orchha Homestay it’s likely you will eat there.\r\nSo there you have it. A quick guide to travel in Orchha.

Just what we needed to end the day.\r\nIn this and upcoming posts, I’ll share the complete Saputara tour guide. A 3 Day Saputara Itinerary that we followed which you also can follow during your Saputara Trip. If you plan to visit Saputara by road, you can read my blog post about Ahmedabad to Saputara Road Trip. We had spent 3 days exploring Saputara hill station, the must-do things in Saputara, the must-visit places in Saputara, we covered it all. So this Complete Saputara tour guide will be a 3 post series based on the activities we did and places we explored in Saputara.\r\nHere’s our day 1 of exploring Saputara Hill Station.\r\nStar of Gujarat – Saputara Hill Station\r\n“Gujarat ki aankh ka tara, Saputara” is what Big B has been quoted saying in advertorials. Saputara is the only hill station in Gujarat. Situated at about 200 kms from Surat and 400 kms from Ahmedabad, Saputara is nestled on a plateau in the Dang forest region. With a height of about 1000m from sea level, Saputara provides high mountains and lush green forests.\r\nSaputrara – Gujarat ki aankhon ka tara\r\nSaputara literally means Home of the Serpents. Once home to a variety of snakes, Saputara Hill Station today has become one of the great weekend getaway destinations. Being just 4 kms away from the Maharashtra border, it has a Marathi crowd as well as the Gujarati crowd. And that also means you get a variety of food too! That was a short brief about Saputara hill station. Let’s now dig into this part 1 of the complete Saputara Tour Guide.\r\nSaputara Tour Guide – Part 1\r\nBefore I talk about the places, I’d like to say that since we were on an invite from the Gujarat Tourism board, everything was taken care of by them. Even the Saputara tour guide that was provided to use for the 3-day itinerary was from Gujarat Tourism. If you are also looking for a Saputara tour guide, one way to do it would be to plan your stay in Saputara at Gujarat Tourism’s hotels Toran.

Apart from that, you will also find a lot of travel operators offering packages to Saputara.\r\nDay 1 itinerary of Saputara\r\nPlaces to Visit in Saputara\r\nSunrise Point\r\nRose Garden\r\nSaputara Lake\r\nNageshwar Temple\r\nJain Temple\r\nSunrise Point\r\nAs a kid studying in a boarding school in Panchgani, one thing that I detest the most was waking up early in the morning and going for a walk/jog. However, when I was in Saputara, I was up at 5 am all set to witness the sunrise. The sunrise point in Saputara is quite close to the city centre. If you have the stamina, you can walk up – there is a proper road leading to the top – else you can take your vehicle to the top.\r\nMesmerizing Sunrise Point in Saputara\r\nWhile the weather in Saputara isn’t guaranteed, be ready for surprises. When we went, we didn’t see the sun, but the views that we witnessed and the breath of fresh air were calming. It’s a wonderful place to click photos, you get some amazing shots with the sun rays peeking out of the mountains. There’s a short trek from here if you want to go further up. The sunrise point is a MUST in your Saputara Itinerary.\r\nRose Garden\r\nThe next place we visited was the rose garden. It’s again located within the city limits and at walking distance from the city centre. The garden boasts of a variety of roses and other flowers when in its full glory. They also have some nice art installations like flamingos and large mushrooms. It’s spread across a large area and you might need some extra time on hand to explore it completely.\r\nSarpganga lake – Saputara Lake\r\nHow common it is to find a lake at a hill station? Extremely common. I could have not missed mentioning Saputara Lake in my complete Saputara tour guide. This is a tourist hotspot and a lot of people visit the lake to enjoy it’s a natural beauty. While most tourists opt for boating here, I’d suggest you wake up early and go for a walk, trust me you’ll thank me! There are various types of boats available based on your choices and the rates vary accordingly too. We skipped boating, instead, we relished some hot chai and corn chat near the lake and enjoyed the views.\r\nSaputara Lake with a view\r\nNageshwar Temple\r\nA saint who resided in this area many years ago had a dream that the Sarpganga lake houses a shiv ling. He requested the authorities who did find a shiv ling in the lake, bought it out and set up the temple. The temple was moved in 1992 to its current location and is a popular destination in Saputara hill station. You can perform pooja at the temple and appreciate the architecture of the temple. A temple by a lake, I had seen only in the movies but this was quite a good experience. It’s called the Nageshwar temple because of the snakehead design found on the shiv ling.\r\nJain Temple\r\nOur last destination of the day was the Jain Temple. Located right below the Sunrise point, the Jain temple is one of its kind. If you are wondering that this is just any Jain temple, you are wrong. The beautifully decorated temple houses a 500-year-old idol of Lord Parshvanath. Jain temples have a characteristic of breathtaking sculptures and design and this is no less. It will surely stun you with magnificence. If you love architecture and heritage, then this Jain temple in Saputara should not be missed.\r\nNageshwar Temple and Jain Temples in Saputara\r\nOnce we were done that, it was already getting darker, the clouds were taking over and the temperatures dropped quite drastically. The visibility also dipped and so did our energies. Walking so much on day 1 and exploring Saputara largely on foot was quite a task. Nonetheless, the folks at hotel Toran were wary of this and had a delicious spread read for us. While some of us decided to spend the night playing cards, others like me hit the sack.\r\nEnd of Day 1 Of Our Saputara Exploration\r\nThe marked the end of day 1 of our Saputara trip. Being the first day, we decided to take things slow and explore the nearby areas. It’s not only when you visit places like Leh, Ladakh, even for small hill stations, but it is also advisable to take it easy on day 1. We explored all the places which are close to the city centre.\r\n\r\n');

Being a popular hill station in the Dang district of Gujrat, Saputara has quite a lot to see. There are the natural habitats of the wild, the holy attractions, as well as a plethora one-of-their-kind tribal craft items. This quiet and quaint hill station also has a handful of interesting historical sites. And if you get bored (which is very unlikely), a lot of other touristy spots, are just a quick bus ride away.\r\n\r\nSaputara is a charmingly small town that is all about feeling good. It has a waterfall, lots of parks, temples, and an arts district with museums.\r\n\r\nAt Gira Falls, the heavenly and cool waters await you. The waterfall comes alive during the monsoons when the rains render the area completely breathtaking to behold. Just drive or hire a bus from Waghai town and you’ll be able to soak up the quiet vibes of this photo-worthy spot. Either bring along your own food or grab a humble bite from the couples of food kiosks available in the area. Don’t leave without picking a few wonderful handcrafted souvenirs sold by the vendors.\r\nAt the Vansda National Park, you can score a sight of a wide variety of fauna, flora and birds. Good for indulging in photography and bird-watching, Vansda National Park has the perfect location: sheer proximity to River Ambica and generous view of the Sahaydri Range, but it\'s easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Hatgadh Fort, the ideal picnic spot, located on the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra, at a distance of about merely 5 kilometres from Saputara. Perched on a hill-top at a height of 3,600 ft, it makes a good spot for short treks. Close to the Hatgadh Fort are situated the reservoirs Ganga and Jamuna that serve the water requirements of the nearby villages. The beautiful sight of the Suragana village and the hills are the reward one reaps from a trip to the fort. These favourable reasons endow this place with so much attraction that it remains abuzz with picnickers and trekkers during the monsoon season.\r\n\r\nOn Ahwa Road, make a stop at the Shabari Dham, the sacred site where Lord Rama blessed the pious tribal woman Shabari by visiting her humble hut with his younger brother Lakshmana during their exile from the Kingdom of Ayodhya. While searching for his divine consort Sita, Rama made a pit stop at Shabari’s cottage and kindly accepted her hospitality by eating the half-eaten berries she served him. The three rocks where Rama, Lakshmana and Shabari sat during their meeting are duly worshipped by the devotees visiting the site. This place where the temple stands today long remained hidden from man’s knowledge until a holy man identified it and let the whole world know of its sanctity.\r\nIf you are craving to get home the choicest handicrafts for your home, the Artist Village run by Chandrakant Parmar and Surya Goswami is your go-to place. Visit the Artist Village or Gandharvapur for appreciating and buying the fascinating artefacts of bamboo crafts, Warli paintings and tribal moulded and designed by the Bhil, Kunbi and Warli tribes. Students of design and art haunt this place for knowledge tours, so do others who are intent in learning the art of making Warli paintings and giving shape to the colourful artefacts.\r\n\r\nRead ahead for in-depth info on the best places to visit in Saputara along with its relentless natural beauty that makes it so irresistible. And that\'s true whether you have been here for only a day, many times or your entire life.\r\n\r\nGira Falls\r\nPhoto by:  Jatanpandya, Creative Commons Attribution Licence\r\nRoughly 2 kilometres from Waghai on the way to Satpura are located the Gira falls about a kilometre down a path from the road. The 30 metre long natural waterfall originates from the Ambica River. Currently, the Forest Department is working on the site to make it tourist-friendly. The area surrounding the waterfalls is very non-commercialised, but tribal handmade items and a couple of small food stalls are located for the convenience of visitors. The best season to visit Gira Falls is July to November.\r\n\r\nVansda National Park\r\n\r\nLocated on the banks of River Ambika, Vansda National Park is enclosed to its North and West by the Sahayadri Range of Western Ghats. Previously a private property of the King of Vansda, the rights of the sanctuary were finally handed over to the State Government. With an area spanning 24 square kilometres, Vansda National park reaches just over the border into Navsari District. Earlier home to the big cats and wild dogs, it is currently a residence of leopard, hyena, jungle cat, macaques, barking deer and the endangered Great Indian Squirrel. With over 115 species of birds and 450 species of trees residing in this area, this park is a perfect retreat for birdwatchers and nature lovers.\r\n\r\nHatgadh Fort\r\n\r\nAbout 3 kilometres from Satpura, towards Satpura-Nasik road, on a small hill is perched the Hatgadh Fort helmed by the legendary Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji. A trek to the fort would interest young travellers up for some adventure. The fort affords gorgeous views of the surrounding valley and is easily accessible by car or bus. It is best to hire a tourist guide to explore the destination. Follow his instructions to avoid slipping into the marshy areas hugging the fort. A carved sculpture of Lord Ganesha is one of the must-see attractions of Hatgadh Fort.\r\n\r\nShabari Dham\r\n\r\nEver wondered where exactly Lord Rama met his tribal devotee and yogin of the yore, Shabari, and gracefully ate the half-eaten berries she lovingly offered him? On Ahwa Road towards Navapura rests a Hindu temple, Shabari Dham, which was set up in 2006 to pay tribute to the remarkable meeting between Lord Rama and the Bhil tribal woman Shabari. The site was unknown to mankind until some time back a famous saint revealed it to all that it was the same place where the landmark event took place. There are three big stones in the temple premises where it is believed that the trio comprising Rama, Lakshmana and Shabari sat. The holy Pampa Lake, which has been given a wonderful description in the Ramayana, is located about 6 kilometres from Shabari Dham.\r\n\r\nArtist Village\r\n\r\nCredit: ThinkStock Photos\r\nIf you have a soft spot in the heart for man’s creative endeavour and cultural heritage of Indian, then a vibrant village called Gandharvapur or Artist Village near the Nasik road is the haven for you.

(62, 'Tawang', 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/twang_story-647_122517115844_0.jpg?Oa6vCcoSAEyHReNmBHZhyzz4ttAYAJcD&size=1200:675', 'A Tawang Travel Guide: Dramatic Escape to the Obscure Himalyan Landscape\r\nTawang, an ancient hamlet studded on the craggy peaks of Himalayas in Arunachal Pradesh, is the last bastion of Tibetan Buddhist monastic community. The indigenous Monpa tribesmen harps on the olden historic way of life. A well chalked out road-trip to Tawang from the plains of Guwahati is a delight for a mountain lover. In this Tawang travel blog, I recount my days of exploring the dramatic landscape of the high Himalayas. The week long road trip to Tawang touched the heart of Bhalukpong, Dirang, Bomdila, Bum La on the way, where mountain life thrives in its glorious existence. \r\n \r\nTawang: Allure of a Distant Azure Himalayan Sky\r\nA place rich with all the strange beauty of your nighttime dreams.\r\nHeinrich Harrer, Seven Years in Tibet\r\nOn the second day in Tawang, I sat breathless under a starlit night in the Taktsang hotel courtyard. My head was bursting out with a teeming pain. I wanted to throw up, but my empty stomach held on to the last bout of life in body. Earlier that day, we returned from the Bum La Pass, a high altitude terrain, home to countless glacial lakes and escape routes from the oppressive Chinese regime that overtook Tibet’s heartland and capital city, Lhasa. \r\nRaghunath, the janitor and a young Assamese boy took pity on me, and sat next with a glass of potable lukewarm water. Our previous conversations were all about me going gaga over the Assamese Thali I tasted on the way up the mountains. The jovial fellow shared with me the secret recipe of his grandma’s duck curry. Hotels and guesthouses in Tawang are mostly run by Assamese fellows. In those roughly ten days of exploring Tawang, we came by locals only a handful of times. \r\nDuck Curry: Assamese style. A treat you must not miss as you road-trip to Tawang from Guwahati.\r\nI recall wondering how my friend Samarpita, whose pictures of prancing around the Madhuri lake with two young kids had originally inspired me to embark on this journey. How she managed to remain unscathed from the Mountain sickness which was pushing me to the verge of giving up? From her posts, I figured she was spending a glorious summer in Darjeeling. Suddenly the roads seemed to be more obscure, the Tibetan Buddhist gomphas seemed to be unforeseen, the road more lethal and those stretching off to faraway lands.\r\nUpon enquiring, I found out she was treading on the route through which Dalai lama made it back to India when the Chinese PLA made advances to gulp down Tibet. The road is thrilling, studded with steep crags and wooded hillsides. The call to traverse this unknown land was inevitable!\r\nDid I regret making this trip, down with a sudden attack of mild mountain sickness? Nay Nay! In all these years of romancing the Himalayan terrains in Himachal, Kashmir, Darjeeling, Ladakh and Arunachal, I would redo Tawang in a heartbeat!  But I will be honest with you. AMS hurts and it hurts very bad. My body, made of all the ingredients found in abundance in the delta of Gangetic plainland, was in shock and memorizes the agony without fail.\r\nStressing on the craggy mountain’s breathtaking beauty is a rather cliché way to describe Tawang, land of high mountain passes and glacial lakes. In absolute truthfulness, visiting Tawang is challenging, requires procuring complex permit procedures even as an Indian national, dangerous to a certain extent considering the steep ascent and thin air and uncertain too. Think snow fall. Think landslide. And the road to Tawang is cut off midway! You will have no other option but to make way back to one of the other ten tourist routes in Arunachal Pradesh. \r\nI did not come to Tawang in the muse of glossy magazine covers and picture perfect postcards. I came here to experience the glimpses of Tibet used to be, as portrayed in the movie Seven years in Tibet, starring Brad Pitt. And I was not disappointed. If you have watched the film, you will know what solemn splendor the Himalayas had showed them at every bend of the road.\r\n\r\nTracing Back History of Tawang\r\nThanks to centuries of British rule, the independent nations of Indian subcontinent inherited a McMohan borderline where dispute is the regular order of the day. Tawang, straddling the border of Tibet (now part of the Chinese map), has suffered for decades. Bloodshed was, bloodshed is an integral part of the old town, housed at an extraordinary elevation of 10,000 ft on the Himalayas of West Kameng.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of Doklam stand-off rendered Tawang rapid change of infrastructure. Long stretched tunnel eliminating the winter obstacle of snow clad Sela pass is being worked on as I type this. BRO (border road organisation) is relentless in curving out an alternate path connecting the barren landscape of the upper Himalayas. A fantastic railroad connecting Bhalukpong to Tawang is being planned. The very thought of taking that train ride is exhilarating, even though a larger part of the road will be in a dark tunnel to maintain ecological balance of the fragile mountains. \r\nIn this slew of proposed and inevitable face-lifting changes, I wonder how Tawang will retain her original identity. \r\nKnown as North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) in olden days, Arunachal Pradesh, the state of India’s far east has historically played home to a number of tribes with distinct lifestyle practices. \r\nIn Tawang, you will meet the nomadic Monpa tribesmen. Wearing a sheepskin Chuba and elaborate headdress made of yak hair, the Monpas are immaculate in the art of Thangka painting and weaving. For centuries, they have been following Tibetan Buddhism, combined with rituals stemming from the scriptures of Bon, the ethnic religion of the region. You will find Monpas residing in Tibet Autonomous Region and Bhutan as well.\r\nThe sixed Dalai Lama was born to a Monpa family. Needless to say, influence of the Tawang monastery in local life is paramount.\r\nHistorically, Tawang has shared strong cultural ties with Tibet. The border was porous with people crossing through the high mountain passes. We are talking about the 1950s, when life was slow paced. Tawang remains buried under a deep snow bed for the prolonged winter months. Geo-political disputes were less uglier than what they seem to be now! \r\n\r\nTibet had claimed Tawang as their own land, resulting in occasional skirmishes until the Chinese PLA aggressively marched forward for Tibet. The ensuing Sino-China war lasted for a while, costing thousands of lives to armed forces on both sides. They withdrew their claim for the time being from Arunachal Pradesh, however you will find remnants of the war on the plains of Tezpur, Assam. We are talking about India in 1960s, a newly formed independent nation with limited resources. \r\nWith the Tibetan capital Lhasa under attach, the 14th Dalai Lama took the perilous night journey traversing the arduous peaks of Himalaya with a caravan of Tibetan men on foot. Upon reaching Bomdila, he sought asylum and was grated so by Indian PM Nehru. In his autobiography, Dalai Lama writes, “India was our only hope!” \r\nThe Red Chinese clashed virulently afterwards, souring the diplomatic relation with our neighboring nation with another billion people. That story is being rewritten everyday.\r\nI was told, many locals in Tawang were startled with the advances made by Chinese. Unaware of who was fighting for their cause, they ended up helping PLA. Many parts of Northeast India has only recently made a mark in the tourist map of India with roads and other tourism infrastructures booming.\r\nIn the 60s, forget about roads, there was hardly a similar language spoken in the hills. “We have only seen mainland Indians in Bollywood movies. I am so glad now you guys are coming to visit us.” Words by an old woman of the Apatani tribe which remains deeply rooted in my heart.\r\nThe mountainous valleys of Tawang are mostly bereft of living souls. Only a few wild yaks graze on the highland. 101 sacred glacial lakes adorn the valley, changing the face to frozen ice to palpable azure reflecting the dome of the sky depending on the time of the year!\r\nPlease note, visiting Tawang also means you will be cut off from the rest of the world at times. Only the major towns or market places had good network connectivity. No hotel had provided us with reliable wifi connection. Digital Nomading is a hard choice in Tawang.  \r\nRoad-trip to Tawang, Suggested Routes\r\nNH 13, the trans Arunachal Highway connects Dirang to Tawang\r\nThings to know before planning a road-trip to tawang from Guwahati:\r\nDistance from Guwahati from Tawang: nearly 500 KM\r\nNearest domestic airport to Tawang: Tezpur\r\nNearest International airport to Tawang: Guwahati\r\nNearest Railway Station: Tezpur Railway station (station code TZTB)\r\nHelicopter ride to Tawang: Pawan Hans conducts a couple of helicopter rides every week from Guwahati to Tawang. However, flying is subject to weather conditions and almost non existent during monsoon months. Price of a helicopter ride is INR 700 and you miss the whole fun of a road trip! Helicopter accidents are rather frequent incident too. Take your call after weighing the risk factors.\r\nRoad trip to Tawang also comes with prized sighting of the Jung falls (Nuranang falls), stopping by the majestic Sela lake by one of the highest motorable mountain pass, paying tribute at the Jaswantgarh war memorial, a martyr’s retiring abode and countless Mahayan Buddhist monasteries in Bomdila and Dirang. If you fly directly to Tawang, or reduce allotted time from the road trip, be prepared to let go of these attractions on the road. \r\nThe Two routes leading to Tawang! \r\nThere are two routes from Guwahati through which you can make this epic roadtrip to Tawang. Both the routes are scenic and span nearly 500 KM in stretch. We have taken one to reach Tawang and the other to make the reserve journey to the plains of Guwahati. \r\nBoth the routes require a span of twelve to fifteen hours of driving, weather permitting, to complete the trip in a day. However, I suggest not to opt for reaching Tawang in a day from Guwahati. Not only you miss the breathtaking scenic beauty enroute, you also do not allow your body to get accustomed to the sudden height (acclimatize). Remember, the mountain air is thin and AMS can become lethal if not dealt with due reverence. \r\nRoute one: (The route we took to reach Tawang for the onward journey)\r\nAlso known as the Chariduar Tawang Road, this route is more scenic and has multiple stops on the road with an established network of hotels and guest houses. Route two takes a slight deviation with NH 13 however eventually merges with the same route from Bomdila. Time taken may be a bit less with Bhalukpong being omitted from the route.  \r\nHowever, if you are running low on time and want to save a couple of days on the road, please consider the second route to Tawang. \r\n\r\n'),

The monastery, built in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama, is amongst the most revered pilgrim spots of Mahayana Buddhism and remains like a thorn in China’s eyes as Tawang manages unparalleled spiritual influence over the people of Tibet since the country’s annexation to the mainland.\r\nThe Dalai Lama was cheered and welcomed by thousands of residents of Arunachal Pradesh. Upon his arrival into Tawang, the people lined up along the streets welcoming him and many even cried on seeing their living deity walk past them. Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which is also referred to as Southern Tibet by the Tibetans, was the closest escape route that could be undertaken by the Lama and his followers if they wished to escape Chinese guns.\r\nIt’s been over 57 years since that fateful day but the heavenly town of Tawang or the state of Arunachal Pradesh still remains a paradise waiting to be explored. Be it the lakes and monasteries surrounding Tawang, the stunning views of the mountains from Bomdila, the lush greenery and the snow-capped mountains of Dirang, or the historic Bum La Pass, the old trading route between Tibet and India that was used by the Dalai Lama to enter India.\r\nTawang\r\n\r\nTawang Monastery\r\nHome to the famous Tawang Monastery, this beautiful destination nestled between the Chinese and Bhutanese borders has some of the most scenic lakes and landscapes all around it. Apart from the Tawang Monastery, the four-hundred years old Urgelling Monastery is a great find and so are the Brahmadung Nunnery, fondly referred to as the Anni Gompa by the locals, and the Tawang War Memorial which is dedicated to our soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Chinese aggression of 1962.\r\nBum La Pass\r\n\r\nBum La pass Gate\r\nThirty-seven kilometers from Tawang and located at a height of 15,200 feet, the Bum La Pass is the actual road through which the revered Lama entered Arunachal in 1959. Visitors to this area need inner line permits that are issued by the Office of the Deputy Commissioner in Tawang District and also need to be stamped by the Indian Army cantonment. But once you leave civilization behind, the drive to the pass feels like a dream woven in clouds. The roads are in bad condition and at times pretty dangerous with low visibility because of the clouds.  But the view out of the car window is nothing short of spectacular. The one-day permit enables you to explore the beautiful Pangatengso and Tsongatser lakes and you can also head to the Tawang Taktsang Monastery while stopping by at the stunning Madhuri (Sungester) Lake.\r\nBomdila\r\n\r\nBlue-throated Barbet At Eaglenest Sanctuary\r\nThe Upper, Lower & Middle Gompas of Bomdila have pretty much preserved the identity of this beautiful tourist town that is also home to the Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. The Sessa Orchid Sanctuary is spread over 100 square kilometers and is home to over 200 varieties of Orchids whereas the 217 square km. Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary plays host to the Bengal Tiger, Black Bear, Asian Elephant, and the Red Panda amongst many others. Once back to the town of Bomdila, delve into a bit of culture with traditional masks and handmade carpets at the Craft Centre And Ethnographic Museum and also visit the Bomdila Monastery.\r\nDirang\r\n\r\nLake at Sangti Valley\r\nHow many times, in your travels, do you come across places that don’t just enthrall you but also make you fall in love with them? Like real love and not just a crush! That’s what a visit to Dirang can do to you. At the very center is a small district called the Dirang Dzong – a small village about fifty kilometers from Tawang where most of the houses are between 400 to 500 years old and there is a 9th Century prison facing perhaps the oldest monastery in Arunachal which is the 500 years old Kalachakra Gompa. The National Research Centre on Yak is another place to visit for the curious minds and once you’re tired of all the trekking then you can relax at the Hot Water Spring Falls. A bath during the winter months is much recommended there.\r\n\r\n'),

Located in the western part of Arunachal Pradesh at a height of about 3500 m above the sea level, the place is both historically and naturally endowed. Because of its remote location, travelling to Tawang is often perceived as difficult to some. But, it is one of the most beautiful places of the north-eastern Himalayas.  Surrounded by the Tibet in the northern part, Bhutan in the Southwest and the Sela ranges in the east, the place can boast of the natural beauty of glacial lakes as well as the snow covered peaks.\r\nTraditional masks at the Tawang Museum\r\nTawang is historically known as ‘Mon-yul’ or the land of the Monpa tribe. In fact, Tawang was traditionally inhabited by the Monpa tribe and they are the majority still now except for the Shyo village that is dominated by the people of Tibetan origin.\r\nTawang is the birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama and is thus of immense importance for the Tibetan Buddhists. The Tawang Monastery is around 400 years old and is of unparalleled significance to the Buddhists.\r\nRecommended Read: Bascon or Basar Confluence – The Cultural Extravaganza at Arunachal Pradesh\r\nThe largest monastery of India – Tawang Monastery\r\nTawang and Inner Line Permit\r\nAll visitors need an Inner line permit (ILP) to visit Tawang, or in any part of Arunachal Pradesh. The Permit is granted as a routine for the tourists and so it should not deter any tourist from coming to Arunachal Pradesh. ILP is issued at these cities – New Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Dibrugarh, Tezpur, North Lakhimpur & Jorhat. Now, one can obtain ILP online too. \r\nRoads being made\r\nHow to reach Tawang\r\nTawang does not have a railhead or airhead. Tezpur (325 km) in Assam is the nearest domestic airport. Guwahati (480 km) is the nearest international airport.\r\nFrom Tezpur, you have to take bus or jeep or private car to go to Tawang. It takes around 12 hours from Tezpur to Tawang. But the scenic beauty of the road more or less makes up for the arduous journey. Enroute Tawang, you have to go through Bhalukpong, Dirang and Bomdila.\r\nWay to Tawang with the clouds beside us\r\nPlaces to see in Tawang\r\n#1. Tawang Monastery\r\nThe main attraction of Tawang is the Tawang Monastery or the Gaden Namgye Lhatse. It is also the largest monastery in India. Situated majestically on a hilltop, the monastery overlooks the entire Tawang district and is considered as a magnificent artwork and the kernel of Buddhist culture and tradition. The monastery was established in 1680 by a monk Mera Lama to preach the tenets of Buddhism. Currently, the monastery houses more than 400 monks. The Parkhang library is also a heritage structure, which stores age old manuscripts. The monastery also has a museum that displays religious objects and artifacts from Tibet and Tawang.\r\nBuddha statue at Tawang Monastery\r\n#2. Urgelling Monastery\r\nUrgelling Monastery is a 400 year old monastery known for being the birthplace of the Dalai Lama VI. This monastery was destroyed during the Mongol attacks and the battle between the Tibetans and the Bhutanese. Only a part of the monastic structure remains today. It is a serene and calm spot with a very few visitors. There is a sacred tree planted by the Holy Dalai Lama VI which is revered and worshipped the locals.\r\nUrgelling Monastery, the birthplac of the Dalai Lama, VI\r\n#3. Tawang War Memorial\r\nThe war memorial was built in memory of the martyr soldiers of the Indo-China war of 1962 that was fought in this region. The memorial has a beautiful stupa. The best part is that the names of all the 2420 Indian soldiers who fought in the war are written here. Various artifacts of the 1962 war are also preserved here. A visit to this place will definitely make you proud of our soldiers.\r\nTawang War Memorial\r\n#4. Nuranang Falls or the Jang Falls\r\nNuranang Falls is one of the most magnificent waterfalls of eastern India. Falling from a towering height of 100 metres, it is simply a spectacular sight. It is around 2 km from the city near the Jang village and is also known as the Jang falls.\r\nThe towering Nuranang Falls or Jung Falls\r\n#5. Sela Pass\r\nSela pass is situated on the way to Tawang. Situated at a height of 13,714 meters, the pass is one of the highest motorable passes of India. Stop at the pass, rest your aching backs from the long journey and look around to see the breathtaking views surrounding you. The snow covered peaks, the colorful fluttering Buddhist prayer flags will make your trip memorable. Move up a little more to see the beautiful Sela Lake.\r\nThe Sela Pass is one of the most important passes of India. It connects Tawang with Tezpur and the rest of India.\r\nSe La Pass\r\n#6. Jaswant Garh\r\nJaswant Garh falls en route Tawang just about 25 km from the city. This is also a war memorial in the scenic backdrop commemorating the brave martyrs of the Indian army during the 1962 Sino-Indian war. The memorial stands in the name of Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat of the 4th Battalion of Garhwal Rifles Infantry Regiment. Jaswant Singh was an exceptionally brave soldier who had single-handedly fought and held back the invading Chinese army for 72 hours during the war. He did not move from his post at an altitude of 10000 feet before succumbing to an enemy bullet in the war. He was awarded the posthumous Mahavir Chakra in recognition of his grit and bravery. The post he held to repulse back the Chinese army was named Jaswant Garh after him.\r\nJaswant Garh\r\n#7. Lake hopping\r\nTawang district is the home to as many as 108 lakes. Some are quite famous and provide your eyes soothing vistas. The crystal clear waters of the lake coupled with the tranquil atmosphere are an absolute delight for the sore eyes and the tired souls. The famous ones are the Sanget Sar Lake or the Madhuri Lake, P. T. Tso and the Sela Lake. While travelling this district, you will see so many lakes, some having names while others are unknown. You will definitely have the urge to stop and look at the calm water bodies.\r\nThe mesmerizing Madhuri Lake\r\n#8. Bumla border\r\nThe landscape beyond Tawang opens up to spectacular wetlands and some diverse sceneries serving as nature’s eye candy. While visiting the Madhuri Lake, you can go on a visit to Bumla Border. Only Indian nationals are allowed to visit the border. It is the Indo-China border situated at a height of 16000ft and is about 37 km from Tawang city. The road conditions are bad, but the scenic beauty makes up for all the trouble. The army post at Bumla border is extremely friendly. They will also invite you for a cup of tea and will be very happy to share their stories with you.\r\nAlso, visit the Tiger’s Nest Monastery nearby. Do not confuse this with the one in Bhutan!\r\nRead our post on Tiger’s Nest Monastery or Taktsang Monastery of Bhutan\r\nBumla Border\r\n#9. Zemithang village\r\nVisit the Zemithang village to experience the life of the local Monpa tribe, their traditions and culture. Visit the Gorsam Stupa which is a sacred Buddhist pilgrimage site. The landscapes of Zemithang are a bit different from Tawang having more of greenery and trees. Staying for a day in Zemithang is highly suggested.\r\nPrayer wheels\r\nBest time to visit\r\nTawang can be visited throughout the year, but the monsoon months from July to September should be avoided. The winters can be really cold with temperatures as low as -10 degrees at night. Mornings are comfortably warm. From April to October, the weather changes from spring to fall and you can experience both sun and rain. During April, the region becomes alive with different flora. In October, the skies are clear and are the best time to see the lakes in their splendor.\r\nA beautiful lake of Tawang\r\nWhere to stay\r\nTawang has a few basic hotels. There are a number of cheap and budget hotels near the market area. There is also a Government Tourist lodge and a circuit house where you can stay after obtaining relevant permits.\r\nVisit Tawang, the pristine paradise filled with Buddhists chants and benign monks. Immerse yourself in the heavenly views, experience the serenity of nature and enjoy the surprises that nature has in store for you.\r\n\r\n'),

Located over 1,000 meters above sea level, Aizawl in Mizoram is a stunningly beautiful city that intrigues visitors as much as it intimidates them. The North-East of India has seen a fair bit of strife, and due to this, travelers are sometimes skeptical about visiting this city, along with the others in the region. However, with the kind of natural, scenic beauty Aizawl offers, it’s hard for anyone to stay away for too long.\r\nLush green hills stretch out in front of you, with little thatched-roofed houses dotting them, welcoming you into the arms of the mountains. The sweeping valleys, the gurgling rivers, the rich agriculture and cultural traditions of Aizawl, one of the seven sisters of the North-East, all come together seamlessly to make this one of the foremost tourist destinations in the country. They say that for a traveler, not visiting the North-East is blasphemous, and Aizawl in Mizoram reiterates this fact.\r\nExploring Aizawl\r\nThe Durtland Hills toward the north of Aizawl are one of the most popular tourist attractions in Aizawl. With a slight nip in the air, these hills offer spectacular views of the city below and make for a great picnic spot.\r\nThough established only a little over 100 years ago, Aizawl has a fascinating past. Relics from this history can be seen at the Mizoram State Museum. For a comprehensive lesson on the history, traditions and culture of the region, a visit to this museum is a must.\r\nShopaholics should rejoice in Aizawl—the locals of the North-East are well known for their heightened sense of fashion, and these local garments and wares can be found in the indigenous markets of the city. One of the biggest and most popular markets here is Bara Bazaar, where you will be spoilt for choice with a huge selection of apparel and accessories to choose from.\r\nNature lovers can visit Hmuifang, a spot about 1,600 meters above sea level, covered in dense forests and preserved since the time of the ruling Mizo Chief before civilization came to the region.\r\nFind Your Way\r\nCity buses and mini-buses are common modes of transport with the locals of Aizawl. You can also hire taxis—cars that are yellow and white—from almost anywhere in the city.\r\nStay Safe\r\nAizawl has seen strife over the years so research thoroughly before planning your trip.\r\nPay attention to local safety tips and guidelines while you’re there.\r\nHow to Reach Aizawl\r\nOn a daily basis there are approximately 6 flights that operate at Lengpui Airport.Air India is the popular airline brand that fly frequently to this airport.\r\nBy road Aizawl is surrounded by Dharmanagar, Lunglei, Hailakandi which are 55.73 km, 58.57 km, 65.73 km away respectively. These places are ideal spots for people to plan their short weekend break.\r\nWhere to stay in Aizawl\r\nAizawl has a total of 1 hotels.There are 1 hotels in Aizawl with the popular ones being Hotel Regency etc.\r\n'),
(66, 'Aizawl', 'https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p091swjv.jpg', 'Mizoram is Christian and proud of it! Everywhere you go they tell you that they are Christian, that they were converted by Welsh missionaries about a century ago and that seems to be for them the beginning of civilization... The first question asked is whether you are a Christian and if so from which church? This is important as there are many, many different churches in Mizoram... One of the Mizo tribes has even claimed they are one of the lost tribes of Israel... And quite a few have left for the holy land... Yes this is a very religious place... So much so, that about 5 minutes into any jeep or bus ride, they pull over and pray for guidance and good fortune on the road... If you are new to this procedure like me, you might mistake the stop for a toilet break and dash out of the vehicle to get rid of some excess fluid... This can be rather awkward when you get back into the jeep and realize they were all praying for their and your safety...\r\n\r\nAs a result of this early Welsh missionary zeal there is not that much left of Mizo culture (at least on the surface) or of traditional villages... If you want to see Mizo culture you will have to come during one of the festivals where they still dress up in their traditional costumes... Other times they have adapted completely to our western dress and behaviour... They even have a Mizo Idols!\r\n\r\nThe trip from Jampui Hills to Aizawl, the capital, went through some very remote areas and here you could still get a glimpse of what things might have been like 100 years ago... There were still bamboo villages and people still wearing some of the traditional clothing... But as we neared the capital it became the usual drab concrete houses with tin roofs... The weather didn\'t help as it rained the entire 3 days we were in Aizawl... The city is nicely located, and I am sure on a clear day the views are amazing... Our views were more of the kind of a little box we call television in our room...\r\n\r\nThen the weather cleared up just in time for us to go down south towards the Blue hills, the highest point in Mizoram and another Tim recommendation... Now you could say that what Mizoram lacks in everyday culture it makes up for in scenic beauty... The road down to Saiha, winds it way through valleys, over hill tops, passing an abundance of magical waterfalls... Of course all this winding means the going is slow, so the journey down took a very long time... But in the end we made it and stayed in the nicely located tourist lodge of Saiha... We were planning to stay one day in Saiha and then move on to the Blue Hills, but the next day we were offered the opportunity of a free ride with the friendly border fencers of India... These guys are fencing the border between India and Bangladesh and had a few days off... They had a jeep and driver and were going the same way (after I told them how beautiful the Blue Hills were, which I had never seen before...)\r\n\r\nThe road first took us to Sangau which is just outside the national park, and from there we had to walk to get to forest rest house on one of the hill tops in the national park... It was a nice walk, filled with blood sucking insects and this time of the year (the rainy part) also with those wonderful little animals called leeches!! But I am willing to donate some blood to nature for some good views... We stayed one night up in the hills and than went back to Sangau where there was a tourist lodge with one of the best views in the northeast!! The border fencer went back to fencing and we stayed at the lodge for another 2 days, enjoying the views, the garden, the good food and the relaxed village life around us...\r\n\r\nThan it was time to return to Aizawl... What should have been a long but not to difficult journey turned into a bit of a nightmare as we got stuck behind landslides and more landslides and more landslides... In the end we made it back to Saiha, after 15 hours and 70 km\'s... We stayed the night in the tourist lodge and continued on the next day, which went smoother... We arrived in Aizawl one day later and on a Sunday, which means everything is closed... But it was good weather for a change so we enjoyed the views and recovered from the journey...\r\n\r\nAfter this it is back to Shillong for a few days of well earned rest and then home .\r\n');

It is the seat of a rich tribal cultural extravaganza and is famous for its handicrafts. The town is blessed with exotic natural beauty. While the river Tlawng flows quietly on the east, on the north one can see the jagged hills of Durtlang.\r\nLocation\r\nAizawl is situated towards the central part of the state and is flanked by rivers and rapids. It is at a distance of 466 km from Guwahati, 366 km from Shillong, and 140 km from Silchar. The Durtlang Hills constitute a natural barrier immediately south of Aizawl, their high ridges punctuated by Mizo villages and Christian missions, and provide pleasant rambling country. Aizawl perches precariously on the steep slopes of a sharp ridge, straddling the watershed between the Tlawng and the Tuirial river valleys at an altitude of 1100 m.\r\nHistory\r\nAizawl as a town does not have a distinct past specifically. The whole state of Mizoram was a part of Assam until 1972 when it was made a Union Territory. There were insurgency problems in the region until 1987, when it was declared a State. Unusually enough, almost all problems of terrorism and demands for freedom have subsided since then. The Mizos are Christians by faith and most of them speak English. In fact, Mizoram has a literacy rate of 87%, which is the second highest in the country.\r\nFairs & Festivals\r\nMizoram is known for its jhum crops and the people of the region celebrate the festivals related to it with traditional gay and pomp. In the months of February to March the clearing of the jungles to make way for sowing is celebrated through the festival of Chapchar Kut. The harvest festival is celebrated during the month of December and is called Pawl Kut. Another festival, Mim Kut, is celebrated after the maize harvest in September in honor of the departed souls. The birth of Christ, and New Year\'s Day are also major festivals.\r\nBest Time to Visit\r\nAlthough it may lack a snowy Himalayan backdrop, it has something of the feel of a Himalayan hill station. It is generally cool during the summers with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30°C and heavy rains during the months of May to September. Winter temperatures range from 10 to 20°C. Fog is commonplace, and the first rays of the sun drive it away to make way for the mountain peaks-a sight that often attracts many tourists.\r\nHow to Reach\r\nBY AIR -\r\nThere are regular flights of Indian Airlines from Aizawl to Calcutta and the journey takes roughly two hours time.\r\nBY RAIL -\r\nThe nearest major rail junction is at Lumding, a further 180 km north of Silchar. Companies operating deluxe buses to and from Silchar, as well as Shillong and Guwahati, are found in Zarkawt.\r\nBY ROAD -\r\nVirtually all visitors to Aizawl arrive by bus from Silchar via National Highway No. 44. Most of the private buses operating on the Aizawl-Silchar route run overnight, except for Mizoram State Transport\'s buses that run during the day. Travelers are advised to allow sufficient time to book tickets at MST\'s not-so-peaceful office, near the GPO and below Zodin Square, where one can also arrange rail tickets for use on the network in Assam. The minibuses that run between central Aizawl and the suburbs head from the top of town near the GPO and Zodin Square to Chandmary in the north.\r\nTourist Attractions\r\nThe State Museum at Babu Tlang is worth visiting and one can have a glimpse of Mizo dresses, implements, historic relics, and other traditional items. The mini zoo has some rare Asian animals in it and the most important one is the endangered sun bear. The Cultural Sub-Center is a good retreat center from the cacophony of modern life and is provided with modern amenities, while providing alluring natural sights. There are a few other attractions as well. These include the zoological garden, Bung picnic spot, MAHCO Showroom, Treasury Square, Vengthlang, and Bethlehem.\r\nPlaces Around Aizawl\r\nTamdil Lake is located at distance of 85 km from Aizawl and is a good picnic spot with boating facilities. For an admirer of natural beauty, Vantwang Falls are at a distance of about 137 km, providing a breathtaking sight of water falling amidst bamboo forests. To take a fantastic view of the Myanmar hills, one can visit Champai, about 192 km from Aizawl. Luangmual is at a distance of 7 km from Aizawl and is a small village\r\n'),

Both these places are very developed and have some great resorts as well as houseboats offering the experience.\r\nWe chose to visit Alleppey because it offers both the town and the houseboat experiences whereas Kumarakom is more a collection of islands and is better if you want to have a totally relaxed experience.\r\nAlleppey – The hub of Kerala backwaters\r\nAlleppey is the at the centre of the Kerala Backwaters, home to a vast matrix of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes and inlets which are formed by more than 900 km of waterways and lie parallel to the Malabar coast also known as the Arabian Sea coast.\r\nInterestingly, these waterways have been used since centuries for essential activities like transportation, agriculture and fishing by the local communities who reside at the edge of the backwaters.\r\nItinerary – 3 days 2 nights\r\nWe have three days and decide to spend one night on a houseboat and one night at the Vembanad Lemon Tree Lake Resort.\r\nHaving already booked a cruise on a houseboat with the help of a friend, we look forward to experience the famed backwaters.\r\nKnow your houseboat\r\nThe vessels which are used as houseboats are basically traditional boats called kettuvallam (made by tying pieces of wood together with coir rope, made from coconut fibres).\r\nIn the olden days, these boats used to collect cargo from villages along the waterways and carried it to traders in town. Now they are used for houseboat trips and are on the wishlist of most of the tourists visiting Alleppey.\r\nExperience life beyond cities\r\nOur houseboat operator is a jovial man and greets us with a nice and cool coconut drink as we board the boat . As the houseboat chugs along the waterways, we take our spots in the deck.\r\n\r\nIt is a different feeling to get a glimpse into the life of people going about their daily chores, like fishing and farming.\r\nWe see some school going children waiting probably for the boat to their home. The simplicity is really striking in contrast to how different life is in big cities.\r\n\r\nI feel at peace while we move past the coconut grove and the lush green beautiful paddy fields.\r\n\r\nLunch is served and we are delighted that the cook has made fresh and delectable Kerala food consisting of chicken curry, rice, Appam, sambar, chutney and buttermilk.\r\nLater, we buy Karimeen fish (Pearl Spot fish) which is cooked for us at dinner time. The curry is tangy and we just love the taste of it.\r\nThe boatman moors the houseboat once the sun sets.\r\nHe tells us that this is done so that fishing activity isn’t disturbed. There are many other houseboats moored near our boat. Some of them disturbing the quiet and peace by playing loud music.\r\nThere is nothing much to do. The signals on the television are weak and there is almost no network on the phone. May be sometimes lack of technology is a boon.\r\nWe spend time talking and playing some board games which are very kindly provided by the boatman. He also shares his experiences of operating houseboats and life in the villages along the backwaters.\r\nWe go to sleep a bit earlier than usual and have a relaxing sleep. In the morning, we have a fresh breakfast. The trip is coming to an end and we say goodbye to the boatman at 9:30.\r\nMy thoughts on whether you should the overnight stay\r\nWhile I did enjoy the 2 day 1 night trip on the houseboat, I would suggest you to skip the overnight stay. While it was a relaxing trip, the boat docks in the evening and after that there is really not much to do.\r\nThere are other options too. You can take a Shikara boat for the day which is smaller in size and can be navigated easily through the smaller canals. You can also hire a private charter and cruise along the backwaters till the evening.\r\nIf you want to explore the backwaters on a budget, there is an option of travelling on Government ferries. It gives you a firsthand experience of observing the locals up, close and personal and travel like they do. Obviously, you can’t stop at your will and since such boats are bigger, they go to limited places.\r\nFringed with coconut trees and lush greenery, Alleppey has already pulled us in its charm. Floating over the green waters, observing people go on about the business of life, a world far removed from our hectic city lives, is a humbling experience.\r\nAn evening exploring Alleppey\r\nThe houseboat trip over, our driver picks us up and we drive down to the beautiful Lemon Tree Resort Vembanad. On the way, we notice that Alleppey is very clean. The lush greenery enhances the beauty of this small city.\r\nOur resort is located on the shores of the beautiful Vembanad Lake. The rooms are great with all amenities and have a great view.\r\nAlleppey Beach\r\nAfter resting a bit, we go to the Alleppey Beach. It is a small stretch of beach but clean. There are a lot of people standing on the shoreline. We see people playing with the waves while we take in the mesmerising sight of the sun going down.\r\nAfter spending some time relaxing, we go and have fresh coconut water from the nearby stall.\r\nThere is a 137 year old pier which extends into the sea and looks as pretty as a picture, though it lays in ruins.\r\nAlappuzha Lighthouse\r\nNearby, is the orange white candy striped Alappuzha Lighthouse towering over the beach. The lighthouse was built in 1862 to aid sailors bringing their boats into the Alleppey port which used to be one of the biggest trading ports in Kerala.\r\nWe climb up the steps to get an amazing 360 degree view of Alleppey (be careful since there are quite a few steps which you need to climb). There is a also small museum with an original oil lamp.\r\nSpending time at Lemon Tree Resort Vembanad\r\nNight has fallen and we head back to the hotel, looking forward to some relaxing Kerala Ayurvedic massage. The massage at the Ayurveda Spa is refreshing and we feel pampered.\r\nDinner is a quiet affair with traditional fare at the Citrus Cafe.\r\nWe wake up next morning to a beautiful sunrise at the Vembanad Lake. It is very quiet and feels like a surreal morning. The only sound which can be heard is the chirping of birds who I think are chatting incessantly.\r\nWe decide to head to the infinity pool and relax a bit. Breakfast is an elaborate affair at Citrus Cafe with a great mix of food-North, South and Continental.\r\nIt is almost time to check out. We stroll about the gardens a bit. And then check out at around 11:00 since we have to head to Kochi.\r\nBest time to visit\r\nAlleppey is best visited between the the months of November and January. The weather is present. Though it is peak season and prices can be really high, it would still be the best time to visit. Summers are really really hot and monsoons are very heavy.\r\nThough Kerala looks very pretty during monsoons (July to October), still sometimes it has such heavy rainfall that it is difficult to explore.\r\nReaching Alleppey\r\nAlleppey is very well connected to Kochi and Kochi International Airport is very well connected to major Indian cities and to Middle East countries and South East Asian countries. \r\nThe Alleppey Railway Station is the nearest railhead that connects the city with major cities like Cochin, Trivandrum and many more.\r\nBuses also ply from some major cities in the South of India like Bangalore, Chennai, Mysore, Trivandrum etc.\r\nI loved my 3 days in Alleppey and also cruising on the lovely backwaters. Hope this post is useful to you\r\n'),

I receive a small commission if you use the links at no extra cost to you.\r\n\r\nThe Backwaters of Kerala are a big bucket list item in India and probably the most popular thing to do in South India! I planned my trip to Kerala so I could meet my friends and we could go out on the Backwaters of Kerala on Christmas Day! (Hence the Christmas Hat in most of my photos!)\r\nBeing in Kerala for Christmas was actually great, firstly its high season in December in Kerala because it’s when the weather is best and secondly because a lot of people in Kerala are Christians and although Christmas in not celebrated in Kerala like it is in the west, we saw lots of lights and had many ‘Happy Christmas’ interactions with locals which was really nice!\r\n\r\nBackwaters of Kerala Tours\r\nAlleppey or Alappuzha as it’s known as it’s Indian name, is one of the most popular and best places to see the Backwaters of Kerala from although there are many other places along the coast of Kerala where you can go from too.\r\n \r\nAlleppey benefits from having its own train station which is just 10 minutes and a 50Rs tuk tuk ride away from the beach where a lot of accommodation is and it’s a main line station. I took a 15 hour train from Goa all the way down to Alleppey in Kerala!\r\nWith that being said, there’s not much else to do in Alleppey and although we spent 2.5 day and 3 nights there, I would recommend 2 nights and 1-1.5 days in Alleppey, do not waste any more time there!\r\nIf you do find yourself in Alleppey with time to spare, a quick bit of research will tell you that you should head to Marari Beach, 15km up the coast from Alleppey. I had read online and in a guide that the beach is like a beach from the Maldives, it’s one of the most beautiful beaches in Kerala… well the beach that I was on was not this at all!\r\nIt was a very local and wild beach which is fine but with that brings a lot of trash, s**t- literally, and not a beach that is a good place to sunbathe on. However I am glad that myself and my friends did go down there as it broke our day up before going out on the backwaters, I got a coconut which I had been craving and we sat in a cafe called Coffee Temple for a while which is really cool- it’s just a few meters from the beach and alongside a canal, it’s a good place to go for breakfast or lunch and was the main highlight of Marari Beach for me!\r\n \r\nWe knew we wanted to do a Backwaters of Kerala tour of course, but then we had to decide between the 4 of us which one to do!\r\nFrom what I can gauge there are 5 options:\r\nCanoe Tour\r\nShikara Tour\r\nHouseboat Tour\r\nPublic Boat\r\nKayak Tour\r\nThe Canoe Tour is, of course, the cheapest and is priced per person meaning it is perfect for solo travellers because you’ll join a group and I was quoted 1000Rs per person for a full day Canoe Tour of the Backwaters of Kerala with lunch. Note – you do not actually canoe, there is a driver and there will be up to 4 people in the same boat. The boats are quite small but the best thing about doing the backwaters this way is that you get to go down all of the small, quiet, side canals that none of the other boats can go down and it’s a full-day tour from about 8:00-17:00.\r\n \r\nThe Shikara Tour is what we choose to do as we didn’t actually want to go out all day on the water. We paid 4000Rs for 4 hours in total including lunch which worked out well between us and we were so happy with the quality of the boat and tour. The boat was a really good size and can fit 8-10 people and at least 6 very comfortably. We didn’t get to go down the small side canals because of the boats size but we did go down a few slightly smaller ones which were so quiet and beautiful and were actually the best part of the trip! If you’re a group of friends I would really recommend this option!\r\n \r\nA House Boat along the Backwaters of Kerala is also very popular for couples, groups of friends and families. They do come with a cost- we were quoted 10,000Rs for one night which was also the same price for the day, however, I’m confident that you can get a boat for quite a bit less, although also a lot more! This price does include all meals which is an added benefit and waking up on the water must be amazing, the biggest downside is not being able to go down any of the side canals! I would not rule this option out in the future as I’d love to experience it.\r\nNote – it’s possible to book all of these boats when you arrive, even the houseboats so don’t worry about looking into it in advance!\r\nFor those who are really on a budget or perhaps want to see the Backwaters for a second time, there is a public boat. I heard that it’s easy to catch and admittedly the boat does go down a lot of the same canals as the tour but the one time I saw the public boat go past it was very busy with locals and unless you’re on a serious budget it’s probably not worth it. If you go all the way to Alleppey to see the backwaters, see them properly!\r\nKayaking is something I did not hear of in Alleppey but a couple I hiked with in Munnar did a Kayak Tour for sunrise and really enjoyed it. There are also full day kayak tours around the Backwaters of Kerala and multiple day kayak tours.\r\n \r\nAs I said, we were really pleased with our Shikara Boat, our driver was friendly, we had a nice South Indian lunch and we could choose what time we wanted this as well as choosing our start and end time giving us lots of flexibility- we went from 11:00-15:00. We put our music on through the speakers, laid out on the front of the boat and on the big bed in the middle and enjoyed the most beautiful scenery.\r\nI really enjoyed just seeing local life too as it’s good to remember people do live here! We saw men and children bathing in the water, women washing and hanging up clothes, men playing games and chatting to each other on the side of the canal.\r\nIt was just such a nice day, and especially a nice Christmas Day to remember!\r\nTo see more of this local side – have a look at my YouTube video as I got some good shots of the locals.\r\n \r\nNot only does Alleppey lack in things to do but also in places to eat although we did find a few places to enjoy food on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day!\r\nCafe Catamaran became our go-to thanks to its location on the beach and closeness to our hotel however the food wasn’t that great and not overly great for veggies!\r\nDreamers Cafe and Restaurant is where we went for Dinner on Christmas Day, they have a huge menu which made choosing from hard but it’s a popular place to eat lunch and dinner in Alleppey so it was good with us!\r\nWe also found that Zostel Alleppey Hostel was the only place serving an early breakfast so we had breakfast there before our tour!\r\n \r\nThere’s also an Indian Coffee House, we didn’t go but I do like visiting Indian Coffee Houses in India for a Coffee and Dosa for Breakfast!\r\nTalking of accommodation, we stayed at Pine Beach Residency which was a good place to stay. Its location was perfect by the beach and close to some other hotels and restaurants. Had I been on my own I would have stayed in Zostel Hostel as it’s really cool or Lemon Dew Hostel which I heard is nice too! \r\n \r\n \r\nI hope this gives you some information ready for your Backwaters of Kerala Trip\r\n \r\n \r\n'),
(71, 'Bir Billing', 'https://devilonwheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Paragliding-at-Bir-Billing.-Picture-Courtesy-Sayantan-Mandal.jpg', 'THREE PALS ON A TRIP – BIR BILLING\r\nGazing out through the window next to my desk, I casually tell my friend Somya how sad and gloomy the Delhi sky looks. I reminiscence my childhood days when the sky was blue, you could see snow like white clouds through which the bright yellow sun used to shine. The sun providing warmth in the cold chilly winters of Delhi was pure bliss. I tell her my favourite thing to do as a kid was to gaze at the twinkling stars in the night or spot a shooting star and quickly fold my hands, shut my eyes and pray for a silly wish to come true. But sadly, the blue sky and stars cannot be caught or endured. She tells me how just a couple of weeks back she was in Ladakh, where it seemed that the sky had worn a blanket of stars and it was completely filled with those bright & tinkly bodies, making the sky beautiful than ever. “Ye haasin wadiyan, ye khula aasman” was a feeling more than a song when you stand in the valleys of Ladakh.  \r\nListening to her paradise-like experience in Ladakh, my face fills up with despair. I tell her how the last holiday I took was two years ago. The next day I reach office at my usual time and see Somya grin ear to ear. She tells me she was up all night thinking about how a little getaway over the weekend in the hills will be perfect for us away from the strenuous and stressful workload and the contaminated carbon emissions winds of the city. I screech in happiness upon hearing this delightful news. We ask our friend Abeer to join us and in less than a second she agrees. \r\nWe start searching for the most ideal and accessible hill stations fro Delhi that won’t be jam-packed by travellers this time of the month. I recall how my friend went to this place called Bir Billing a while back and had the most heavenly experience. I quickly opened my browser tab and look up information about Bir Billing. This is what I came across.\r\nA LITTLE INSIGHT\r\nBir Billing is found near the Kangra valley in Himachal Pradesh. People across the world travel to study ecotourism and meditation. The place has a prominent Tibetian presence that can be witnessed. The most prevalent in the area is the Tibetian colony that is found in the outskirts of Bir. The colony came into form around 1960 when Dalai Lama left Tibet amidst chaos in China. He travelled for two weeks to reach India. Following his exile, Chokling Rinpoche formed the Bir Tibetan Colony. The Tibetian colony is home to many Tibetian monasteries, institutes, schools, medical centres, eateries, accommodation facilities, a Tibetian handicraft centre and much more. Bir billing came into the limelight after it hosted the first paragliding world cup in 2016.\r\nIt is famously called the Paragliding capital of India and is the second-best paragliding site in the world. Bir is the take-off spot and Billing is the landing point for Paragliding. Bir Billing provides the aptest condition for paragliding. Paragliding requires extremely smooth winds for a perfect takeoff. The correct measure of cloud base and suitable air currents drag paragliders and people willing to experience this adventure sport from all corners of the world. Bir Billing is actually the hub spot for people who want to become paraglider guides. Numerous courses are taught in Bir Billing. The smaller course stretches for a  period of ten days and the fees for it is 30,000. A longer paragliding course extends for a duration of 30 days. The fees charged is approximately 50,000. Many solo paragliders also come to Bir Billing to benefit from the ideal conditions.\r\n A not so crowded place to elope over the weekend, Bir Billing seemed like the perfect option. We hired a taxi with a designated chauffeur that will take us to our holiday destination. The three of us, decide that the 15th of November is the perfect date for us to leave for Bir Billing. The day arrives and I can’t contain my excitement. After finishing my work with absolutely zero will and excitement I can no longer contain, we finally head out. After grabbing a bag full of snacks, and water for our ride we start our journey. An hour and a half into our ride, me and my friends are starving for food. Without putting too much thought, we decide to have dinner at the most famous place for road travels from Delhi to the northern part of India. The Amrik Sukhdev Dhaba is popular for its delicious meals. Every dish, sweets, or drinks that you could probably imagine is present inside the outlet. The most preferred include the mouth-watering aloo paranthas. After filling our stomachs and clicking a couple of pictures we started our journey again.\r\nIt is around 4 pm, I rub my eyes and look out of the window and the sun is still not out. The food overload at the Dhaba caused me to doze off. I asked my driver where we are, and he mentions we are just a couple of minutes away from entering the hilly region of Himachal Pradesh. I obviously cannot contain my enthusiasm, and have my eyes fixed out to witness the glorious scenic route. My friend Somya also wakes up and both of us are now looking up in the sky waiting for the sun to come out. The sun takes its own sweet time but is finally out. The most stunning sunset peeping through the mountains forming the most stunning spread of vibrant colours. The sky is blue with a hint of orange and yellow. We obviously have our cameras out but, no amount of words or pictures can describe what our eyes saw at the early dawn. \r\nIt starts drizzling and we stop for breakfast at a cafe called Maggi Point. A flight of green stairs leads us inside the cafe. Apart from a lovely old couple running the cafe and providing us with the most scrumptious breakfast early in the morning, we are greeted by the cutest golden retriever named Rocky. Abeer is recalled of her dog back home. In no time he sleeps on her lap. The most heartwarming sight you will ever get to see. Just 7 km away from Maggi Point, we head to Mcleodganj.  \r\nIt is around 11 am and we are in Mcleodganj. Since we were short of time we decided only to trek to the well-known Bhagsunag Waterfall. We pass by many shops that sell souvenirs and junk jewellery for you to buy. We pass by the Bhagsu Nag temple and begin our trek. The trek is a little steep. The path is slightly rocky and the stairs are uneven. So, you might want to pace yourself and not rush into it. Whenever you feel tired keep drinking the fresh cold water coming out of pipes to refresh yourselves. After some huffing and puffing, we finally reach the waterfalls and it is as spectacular as one can imagine. We sit on the little cosy corner with jute chairs that have been created for tourists to enjoy and cherish the stunning view. A little while later when we have finally caught our breaths when we notice a Shiva cafe board that is just 2 km away. We decide to head to the cafe as the distance didn’t seem much. Just 2 mins of walking, me and Somya have out probably said it loud a hundred times and thought about it approximately a million times of dropping the idea and heading back to our car. The path to the cafe will make you think that too. It will also make you think if the board was just to mess with you or is it worth the hassle but, Abeer Motivates us to continue walking. Let me tell you, all the effort was worth the hassle. The Shiva Cafe is what you probably didn’t imagine. The architecture is beautiful. The cafe has mattresses laid out with tables. A black coffee, pizza, sandwich and few Instagram stories later we head back to where our car had been parked. \r\nMcLeod Ganj to Bir Billing is just 3 hours away. The path is lit with vibrant, and colourful cottages that will want you to reside here forever. Around 5 pm we enter our camp stay Shivarama Glamping. As the three of us were looking for a nice camping experience, we booked the Shivirama Glamping that is famous for its accommodation facility in Bir Billing. Since we were there only for a night it was the perfect option for us. Apart from the camp-like experience, they included dinner and breakfast in our package. Bonfire night was also organized that made the evening perfect. If you are planning to stay here then you can choose a package according to your requirements. \r\nThe next day arrives and I am jumping with excitement. The day I have been waiting for the longest time. Paragliding has always featured on top of my adventure bucket list and since Bir Billing is the Paragliding capital, it couldn’t get more perfect. We bid adieu to our campsite and head straight to Billing. Many paragliding experts and instructors are present there. We talk to them about availing their services. I had read online that they charge 2000 rupees for paragliding and an extra 500 rupees if you want to capture your experience on a GoPro. Abeer with her great bargaining skills got it down 1850 rupees. They made us sign some documents and in a minute we were sitting on the back of a camper heading straight to Bir. Approximately 40 mins later we reached Bir. Bir is the take off-site and is 8000 ft. above sea level. My instructor straps the gear on me quickly and I am ready. They hand me the camera and pull me downwards adding weight and some flight. Before I could even prepare myself, I am already in the middle of nowhere. My guide asks me how I feel and I don’t think so I have been short of words. I am dumbfounded and absolutely awestruck at the magnitude at which I am. A seat is made for you to sit, so, I can easily say that this probably the most comfortable seat I have ever sat on. The birds-eye view of the dense green trees or the towering mountains adjacent to me is a view I will never forget. In 15 to 20 mins we land at Billing, the Landing site. I am definitely sure that I am never going to forget the mammoth of height I was at and will surely cherish it my entire life. And if lucky enough will definitely come back to feel this emotion again.\r\n After this massive experience, I am starving. So, we quickly decide to head out to a cafe for food. Bir Billing is filled with Instagram perfect cafes.\r\nBelow is a list of cafes you might want to visit.\r\n1. GARDEN CAFE\r\nA BEAUTIFUL GARDEN SET UP WITH DELICIOUS FOOD TO CHOOSE FROM, THE GARDEN CAFE IS A MUST-VISIT. DON’T FORGET TO ORDER THE SINFUL CHOCOLATE PANCAKES FROM HERE.\r\n \r\n2. GLIDER’S PIZZERIA\r\nThe Glider’s Pizzeria is famous for baking the best pizzas of Bir Billing. The cosy and comfortable cafe makes for a nice place to have your meal. It is slightly on the expensive side so, do keep your budget in mind before heading to the cafe.\r\n3. SILVER LININGS CAFÉ\r\nAnother tourist favourite, the Silver Linings Café is a must-visit of Bir Billing. This cute cafe has a small library through which you can pick books to read for the time your food is being prepared. Try the coffee and dessert for an enriching experience.\r\n4.

The village attracts tourists from all corners of the country to experience the Gunehar waterfalls. The waterfalls have a height of 100 ft. a little trek around the village will land you up to the waterfalls. the crystalline and transparent water accompanied by the rocky landscapes is a sight to capture. The Dhauladhar mountain behind the waterfalls enhances the stunning view visible to the naked eye. you can also enjoy jeep rides or a hike to explore the village.\r\nThe Bir tea factory found near the Bir market.

The first one is ‘offbeat destination’ and the second one is ‘adventure sports’. Bir Billing is a name that qualifies on both. It is a small town located about 65 kilometers from Dharamshala and is home to a large Tibetan exile community due to which it is also known as ‘mini Dharamshala’. But that is not what it is really famous for. At an altitude of 1,525 meters, it is most known for India’s best paragliding experience. In 2015, an event for Paragliding World Cup was held here, after which the small and almost unknown town came to limelight and became of a favorite among adventure enthusiasts. The very name of the place now stands as a synonym to paragliding and several other adventure sports like trekking and mountain biking.\r\nBir is also home to several Buddhist monasteries, institutes, and NGOs. But what you will not find here is the regular tourist crowd like in the towns of Mcleodganj and Dharamshala. Majority of the visitors in Bir Billing will be the ones looking forward to paragliding and the rest will be the ones interested in meditation courses, volunteering, and ecotourism. This makes Bir a perfect place for anyone wanting to spend time at a peaceful place without going too remote. For paragliding, there isn’t a better place to experience it in India. How can you plan a trip to Bir Billing, where can you stay and what can you do there is what I will be discussing in this article\r\n \r\nKnow Bir Billing\r\n\r\nAbout Bir Billing\r\nThe names Bir and Billing are always clubbed together as one but these are in fact two different places. The name of the village or town is Bir and it is divided into two parts. The Bir that is known to the tourist community is called Chaugan, also known as ‘Tibetan Bir’. The original settlement or the village is now known as ‘Upper Bir’ or ‘Bir Proper’ or ‘Indian Bir’. It is a small market and surrounding farming community, located in the foothills above Chowgan at a distance of about 2 kilometers.\r\nBilling, on the other hand, is a ridge top used as the launch point for paragliding. It is at a distance of about 16 kilometers from Chaugan and 14 kilometers from Bir. You drive up to the top, sail off in the air and land at Chaugan. More experienced fliers actually can reach as far as Dharamshala, Mandi, and even Manali. Both Bir and Billing are connected by a small but smooth road.\r\nLocation of Bir Billing\r\nBir is located in Joginder Nagar Valley of Himachal Pradesh; at a distance of 65 kilometers from Dharamshala; 160 kilometers from Manali; and 520 kilometers from Delhi. Billing is located another 16 kilometers ahead of Bir.\r\nBir Billing Altitude\r\nBir is at an altitude of 1,525 meters (5,003 ft.) whereas the paragliding launch site in the meadow at Billing is at an elevation of 2400 meters (7874 ft.) \r\nWhy should you visit Bir Billing\r\nBir billing is well known for its paragliding experience and that is what you should visit here for. There are several reasons why it is considered as one of the top sites for paragliding in India. The topography of the region, weather and wind conditions make wind sailing here a pleasurable experience and can be done for a longer duration. Since it has evolved into a paragliding base, there are several companies and instructors to choose from with plenty of experience behind them. This also makes paragliding here a bit safer than other places.\r\nHowever, if you have no interest in Paragliding, you can still visit Bir Billing to spend some time in peace. There are plenty of treks around here that you can venture upon. You can also visit the monasteries, taste some Tibetan food and observe Tibetan lifestyle. Mountain Biking is another fun activity to enjoy in Bir Billing and you can easily get a bike on rent here.\r\nIf nothing else, then just spend some time in the beautiful valley, taste some amazing food, click loads of pictures and have a great time. You will not feel it overcrowded like Shimla and Manali but at the same time, you will also not go too far away from civilization or too remote. The town is easily accessible and has great mobile connectivity which can be of reassurance to a lot of people, especially the ones visiting with family.\r\nAlso Read: Palampur – A Complete Travel Guide & Itinerary\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing\r\n\r\nConnectivity to Bir is really great and reaching the town will not be a problem at all. It is located in an area that is one of the most visited ones in all of Himachal. It is not only important in terms of tourism but also religiously and to some extent politically as well. As a result, you can reach here in all 12 months and by several modes of commute.\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing from Delhi\r\nLet me begin with first explaining how you can reach Bir if you were traveling by road and your own vehicle. For the sake of explaining the route, I will assume Delhi as your starting point. However, even if you were coming from a different town, the following information can still help you understand how you can arrive at Bir and then reach Billing.\r\nDelhi – Panipat – Karnal – Kurukshetra – Chandigar – Anandpur Sahib – Amb – Kangra – Palampur – Bir – Billing\r\nThere can, of course, be several other variations to this route but the one I mentioned above is the quickest. Traveling this way, Delhi to Bir Billing will be about 520 kilometers and will take you a total of 11-12 hours to complete; depending on your speed and breaks.\r\nDelhi to Bir Billing Road Condition\r\nThe journey may be long but the good part is that the road remains to be a smooth one for most of the journey, even up in the hills. There are a few bad patches in between but for the majority of it, it is smooth sailing all the way.\r\nBest Vehicle for Bir Billing\r\nThere is really no best vehicle required for visiting Bir. I have seen the locals there driving around in old Maruti 800 as well. So as long as your vehicle is well maintained, serviced and is not too old, you can drive to Bir Billing by any car or motorcycle. If you were coming by a smaller engine bike though, I will recommend traveling light and solo.\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing from Dharamshala\r\nBir is about four hours from Dharamshala and McLeodganj by road. If you weren’t traveling by your own vehicle, you can rent a taxi for Bir which is the most convenient way to travel between the two places. A hatchback or a Sedan will cost you about Rs. 1200 to drop you at Bir in about 2 to 3 hours. \r\nFor budget travel, there are two daily buses from Dharamshala for Bir. The buses leave from Dharamshala at 6 AM and 2 PM everyday and travel all the way to Bir Road/Upper Bir. It takes about 3-4 hours to complete the journey. If you could not find a direct bus for Bir, then board any bus going towards Palampur or Baijnath. From Baijnath there is a Bus leaving for Upper Bir every half an hour. \r\nAlso Read: What to see in Manali | Places to Visit in Manali\r\nHow to reach Bir by Bus\r\nHRTC Operates a regular Bus for Bir from almost all nearby major cities. If you were coming from Delhi, you can board the bus from Inter-state Bus Terminal (ISBT). Apart from HRTC, several private tour operators also provide this service as well. You can check the availability for HRTC buses on its Online Portal. There are no direct buses for Bir though. Most of these buses will either drop you at Baijnath or Bir Road and then you will have to board another bus for your final leg of the journey like I explained above.\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing by Train\r\nNearest Railway Station to Bir is located at Ahju at a distance of about 3 kilometers. It is connected by a narrow-gauge line from Pathankot to Jogindernagar; the well-known Kangra Valley Toy Train. It is much similar to the Shimla Kalka Toy train and is a great way to travel if you had some leisure time.\r\nThe nearest broad gauge railway station is at Pathankot (112 km) from where the toy train starts in the morning and takes around 7 hours to complete the journey till Ahju. Most of the trains from Delhi arrive at Pathankot just before the Toy Train starts. For someone looking forward to enjoying a relaxed journey through the mountains, rivers and green pastures, Kangra Valley Toy Train is the best choice.\r\nHow to reach Bir from Pathankot\r\nThe toy train, however, is a long and tiring journey; and can often get a bit crowded as well. It is only for someone who can afford to spend 7-8 hours on a slow-moving train. If you wanted to complete the journey quicker, then the next best choice for you is an HRTC Bus. You can reach Pathankot by train and board a bus for Bir which will take about 5 hours to complete the journey. If you could not find a bus for Bir direct then look for a Bus to Palampur or Baijnath.\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing by Taxi\r\nIf Bus was not a convenient way then you can opt to travel by a private taxi as well. You can get a taxi from Pathankot for Rs. 3000 approximately for a drop to Bir.\r\nHow to reach Bir Billing by Flight\r\nThe nearest airport to Bir Billing is the Gaggal Airport, located at a distance of about 65 kilometers. It is also known as Kangra Airport or Dharamshala Airport and is well connected by multiple airlines to Delhi, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune. There are regular flights available by Air India and Spice Jet. Once you land at the airport, you can rent a taxi for the last leg of your journey to Bir from right outside the airport itself.\r\nLocal Transport in Bir Billing\r\nFor moving around locally in Bir, you can easily get a taxi from the Upper Bir Bus stand or the main intersection of the Tibetan colony. There is also a local Bus service that connects some parts of the town. If you were up for it, you can also easily walk around from one part of the town to another.\r\nAlso Read: Dharamshala Mcleodganj Trip – How to Plan & What to See\r\nPlaces to visit & Things to Do\r\n\r\nWhat to see in Bir Billing \r\nMentioned below are some tourist places in Bir Billing that are worth a visit.\r\nMonasteries in Bir Billing\r\nIt is usually the towns of Dharamshala and Mcleodganj that are known for their monasteries.

If you have never done Paragliding before, it will surely be a memorable trip for you. Sailing through the skies over the beautiful mountain peaks for the first time is an experience that you will remember forever, no matter how many times you do it again.\r\nYou do not have to have any kind of experience for paragliding. Rides here are available for both experienced fliers (solo ride) and first-timers (with an instructor). Duration of a flight can be anywhere between 20 to 60 minutes and will cost you from Rs. 2500 to Rs. 6000. The price entirely depends upon how long your flight was and how well you were able to negotiate with the operator. There is a lot of competition among them here so if you were good at negotiating, you can definitely get them to lower the cost a bit.\r\nAs a first timer, you will, of course, go for a tandem ride. This is when the instructor and you will be flying on the same chute. The instructor, or the pilot as they call themselves, will be maneuvering the chute and you will just be enjoying the ride and taking pictures. For people interested in flying solo, you will have to take a short duration flying course which is offered here by many operators. These courses last for 2 to 3 weeks post which you will get your certification and will be allowed to take a flight solo.\r\nAlso Read: Mashobra – A Complete Travel Guide & Itinerary\r\nTrekking in Bir Billing\r\nBir Billing is a center of adventure activities and paragliding is not the only one in the list. The next two entries of Trekking and mountain biking are equally thrilling. There are several long and short treks out of Bir that you can venture upon. The most known ones are the treks leading to the villages of Raj Gundha and Kukkar Gundha. Billing to Raj Gundha takes about 5-6 hours to reach. So if you had a couple of days to spare, you can trek to the village, camp there for the night and return to Bir the next day. The trail passes through a scenic route covered with Rhododendron, Deodar and Oak trees; and provides great views of views of Kangra valley on one side and Raj Gundha valley on the other side.\r\nHanumangarh Trek is another 5-6 hours long trail that takes you to the pilgrimage site.

It is a 4 km Steep trek to Tatta Paani camp site.\r\nMountain Biking in Bir Billing\r\nAfter Paragliding and Trekking, third adventure sport in the list is of Mountain Biking. There are several beautiful trails in the area that you can enjoy while biking through picturesque scenery. This, of course, is not everyone’s cup of tea and you would have to have some experience in cycling before you try biking in Bir Billing. Bikes can easily be availed on rent.

Winter here is harsh and it gets terribly cold in the months of January and February. It does not snow in Bir town but the upper areas of Billing can receive as much as 2 to 3 ft. of snow sometimes. Spring arrives towards the end of March and this is when the weather here is at its best, with clear sunny skies, warm days and pleasantly cool nights. It remains so until April but things begin to heat up in May and June. The day temperature in these months can sometimes go as far as 35-40 degrees Celsius.\r\nMonsoon arrives towards the end of June and it continues to rain here until early September. Dhauldhars are in fact one of the wettest regions of Himachal which means that it rains here quite a lot. September marks the end of monsoon season and is one of the most pleasant months of the year here. Autumn arrives in October; and everything that was green in September now turns to a golden orange; giving a magical touch to the valley. Winter again starts to settle in towards the end of October; and the following months of November and December are probably the driest and most dull time of the year here.\r\nThe average temperature during summers is around 20 to 35-degree Celsius from April to June. Monsoon season tends to get quite wet with heavy rainfall and winters are mild to chilly between October and February. The night temperature can sometimes fall even below 0-degree Celsius in the months of late December and January.\r\nWhen to visit Bir Billing\r\nNow based on the information above, I think it is safe to say that the best time to visit Bir Billing is in the months from April to June; or September and early October. But this will also depend on your reason to visit. If Paragliding was your primary reason then you can come anytime between March and June; or in October and November. If photography was your reason then you should visit in either April, September; or early October. If you did not mind the rain then you will actually get some of your best shots in July and August. But if you do not like wet areas or the monsoon season then you should avoid visiting from late June to early September. If cold is not your thing then do not visit between November and March.\r\nIf you want to enjoy paragliding as well as some snow then you should visit in January or February. Bir does not get any snow but Billing does and sometimes enough to block the road. Paragliding, however, remains on during the winter season as well. You will drive with the paragliding operator till the point the road was free of snow and will then walk the last distance to the ridge. November and December are overall a bad time to visit because the scenery will be very dull in these months. Weather will be very cold and there won’t even be any snow around at Billing.\r\nIf you just want to enjoy pleasant weather then plan in either April, May or September. Otherwise, you can visit Bir Billing in any month of the year to spend some time in peace and get away from our regular lives. It is a very scenic and peaceful place and worth a visit.\r\nWhat to Pack\r\n\r\nClothes to Pack\r\nWhat clothes you should be packing for visiting Bir Billing entirely depends on your time of arrival. For a trip in the months from November to February, you must bring heavy woolens and a windproof jacket. Ensure that your jacket has a hood as well to protect your head and neck. If it doesn’t then you should also pack a warm cap and a muffler. If you are planning to paraglide in winters then you must completely wrap and cover yourself.\r\nFor visiting in April, May, June, and September, just bring your regular cotton clothes along with a light jacket and that will suffice. Summers can get really hot here and you may not even need a jacket at all but just pack one to be on a safer side. For visiting during monsoon season, pack clothes that can dry faster, like polyester; or just your regular light cotton clothes. For visiting in October and March, pack some light woolens and a heavy windproof jacket. Good quality gloves will be a necessity during the winter season. Along with your clothes, pack a pair of shoes that has a good grip, possibly a pair of trekking shoes.\r\nOther Items to Pack\r\nListed below are some items to pack that can be really useful.\r\nDo not forget to bring along your selfie stick if you wish to capture some pictures or a video of your flight.\r\nWarm Caps\r\nPair of Waterproof Warm Gloves\r\nSunglasses\r\nSunblock lotion with highest SPF that you can find (if visiting in summer)\r\nPrescribed medicines if you are on medication\r\nHead Phones/Earphones\r\nPower Bank (If you own one)\r\nChargers for your electronic items\r\nUmbrella or a Rain Poncho (if visiting during monsoon)\r\nTorch\r\nComfortable lower if planning to go on a trek as jeans is not advisable for this purpose\r\nAlso Read: Triund and Snowline Trek Mcleodganj\r\nWhere to stay in Bir Billing\r\n\r\nBir Billing has several hotels, campsites, and homestays that you can stay at. Depending on your own preference, you can choose to stay at either of the places. Accommodation rates range from Rs. 500 to Rs. 2500 per night. There are a lot of homestays as well in Tibetan Colony where you can stay but please note that Bir Tibetan Colony is classified as a protected area; which means that foreigners can visit here but cannot stay overnight unless they obtain a Protected Area Permit (PAP) before arriving.  This can be availed from Dharamshala.\r\nCamping in Bir Billing\r\nThere are a few campsites as well in Bir where you can stay if you do not want to be confined in the cemented walls of a hotel. Camp Oak View is the one where I stayed and it probably is the most famous one here. My stay with these guys was a convenient one and the food too tasted quite good. They may sound a bit on the costly side but give them a try if within budget.\r\nAlso Read: Kasol and Kheerganga Trip – A Mesmerizing Experience\r\nFood & Shopping\r\n\r\nShopping in Bir Billing\r\nChoices of shopping in Bir Billing are not that great. You can buy some artificial jewelry, woolen garments, handicrafts, etc. but a better option would be to head out to Dharamshala and buy all these things there. The items on display will be the same but you will get better options and price in Dharamshala. There are a few shops in Bir Bazaar in Bir proper and a few in Tibetan Colony where you can shop some. In the Tibetan Colony, there is a handicraft center selling a variety of handmade products at a reasonable price. While you are in the town, pay a visit to the tea gardens and don’t forget to buy some freshly picked tea.\r\nWhat and Where to eat in Bir Billing\r\nBir Billing and the nearby areas of Dharamshala and Mcleodganj have a mix of Indian, Tibetan and a fair share of people from other countries as well due to which, the food here ranges from Indian to Tibetan, to Chinese, to Italian and a lot more. Just take a walk through the town and you will come across numerous restaurants that you can eat at. The traditional Himachali Thali is a must-try dish.

For the sake of providing the information, I will assume Delhi as your starting point. However, even if you were coming from a different town, only the information for the first and last day will be different. Rest of the details will still apply.\r\nDay 1: Delhi to Dharamshala\r\nTravel to either Dharamshala or Mcleodganj on your first day\r\nAbout 500 kilometers in total\r\n11-12 hours of journey\r\nOvernight in Dharamshala\r\nDay 2: Dharamshala to Bir Billing\r\nTravel to Bir Billing\r\nSpend the day sightseeing on the way\r\nVisit Kangra Museum, Norbulingka art Gallery, Maa Chamunda Temple, Palampur Tea garden and Baijnath Temple.\r\nOvernight at Bir\r\nDay 3: Bir Billing\r\nStay in Bir on this day and enjoy Paragliding\r\nVisit Buddhist Monasteries, Deer Park, Bir Tea Garden & Local Tibetan market in the later half of the day\r\nDay 4: Bir to Delhi\r\nReturn home on Day 4\r\nAbout 500 kilometers of distance\r\n11-12 hours of travel time\r\nAlso Read: Triund Trek – How to Plan your Adventure\r\nFacilities Available & Travel Tips\r\n\r\nBank / ATM in Bir\r\nThere are several banks and ATMs in Bir and you will have no problem finding cash here.

You may want to ask him about how old the glider was and take a look at the age sticker. If the glider was over 7 or 8 years old, it would be best to talk to some other operator. Do not eat a heavy meal before the flight. The best option would be to bring along your selfie stick to capture a video of your paragliding experience. Or you can also avail the GoPro service provided by operators for about Rs. 500. They also have photographers at the landing site who can take your picture just before or while landing. This will cost you about Rs. 200.\r\nAlso Read: Monasteries in Mcleodganj and Dharamshala\r\nFAQs about Paragliding in Bir Billing\r\n\r\n1.

Upper Bir village is inhabited by farmers who also run the business of paragliding. This setting makes Bir Billing home to some beautiful monasteries, meditation studies, and delicious Tibetan food.\r\n\r\nThe charming village of Bir in Kangra valley shot to fame in 2015 when Paragliding World Cup was organized here. It is the second-best site in the world and foremost in Asia for paragliding.\r\nBilling (alt-7800 ft.) is 14 km away from Bir and is the take-off site for paragliders. A pristine, off-beaten and uncluttered trek, winding through Himalayan pine forests, connects Bir to Billing.\r\nGetaways from Dharamshala – Bir Billing (65 km)\r\nNext in my series of getaways from Dharamshala, in this article, I will share my experience at Bir Billing and why it is much more than just a paragliding destination. \r\nWhy Visit Bir – Billing\r\nGo there to experience the adventure of paragliding. If you aren’t the too-adventurous type, then enjoy the beautiful treks around, visit the serene monasteries, relish the Tibetan food or rent a mountain bike to explore the virgin treks.\r\nThis place is best suited for paragliding because of its topography, climatic conditions, and nature of wind here. The take-off and landing sites are at perfect altitudes, wind direction and speed ensures smooth sailing for longer durations as compared to other sites in India.\r\nHowever, there are plenty of treks around to explore and Tibetan culture to experience. \r\nBir Billing Sightseeing & Things to do\r\nLet us look at some of the tourist attractions and things to do in Bir Billing.\r\nParagliding in Bir Biling\r\nThe obvious and most exciting thing to do here is paragliding, which is sure to be a memory of a lifetime for you. Conducted by numerous operators, the activity is available as both solo ride and tandem ride (with a professional instructor).\r\nFirst-timers should opt for a tandem ride in which one enjoys the ride, and the professional paraglider who flies along with the rider will do the job of take-off, landing, and steering across the skies.\r\nShort duration courses in paragliding are also offered by many operators that enable you to ride solo. As this is a highly skilled adventure, one requires 10-15 days of training before flying solo safely.\r\nRemember to eat light before the flight and carry a selfie stick if you would like to shoot yourself during the ride. Otherwise, opt for the Go Pro service provided by operators for around INR 500. Their photographers are also available at landing sites to click you while landing, this costs INR 200. \r\nDuration of a gliding session can be between 20 to 60 mins, and cost varies from INR 2000 to 6000, depending upon the length of flight and proximity to Dhauladhars. There are longer flights that take you closer to Dhauladhars, at a higher cost. However, flight costs are negotiable for most operators.\r\nMonasteries Nearby\r\nIf you would like to explore more monasteries beyond the ones in Dharamshala then you would find them here.\r\n \r\nPaplung Sherabling monastery is the biggest in this area and is set amidst pine forests at Bhattu village, 7 km from Bir. Chokling monastery is another place to find serenity. This is also one of the most beautiful monasteries in Kangra.\r\nDeer Park Institute, almost 4 km away from Bir is a beautiful place to be, especially if you are interested in Indian philosophy, science, and art. The institute aims to recreate the spirit of Nalanda, India’s ancient university and center of wisdom.\r\nBir is also famous for ecotourism and voluntourism. Dharamalaya Institute is one of the places that give you a chance to experience both. It offers classes (both short-term and long-term) in ecology, meditation, organic farming, green building, and many other disciplines to promote sustainable and responsible tourism in the region. \r\nTreks or Hikes around Bir Billing\r\nThere are a few treks around Bir if you plan to extend your trip and explore the surrounding area.\r\nTrek to the semi-nomadic villages of Raj Gundha and Kukkar Gundha is of longer duration and provides beautiful views of Kangra valley on one side and Raj Gundha valley on the other side. You can cover Billing to Raj-Gundha can be covered in 4-5 hours; you may end your journey here, camp at the village, and come back or continue to Kukkar Gundha.\r\nThe trek is scenic and laced with Buransh (Rhododendron), Deodar and Oak trees which fall under the forest area of the Dhauladhar wildlife sanctuary.\r\nHanumangarh Trek takes you to the ancient pilgrimage site. Reaching Hanumangarh from Billing takes about 5-6 hrs. The trek is easy but long and may get tiring for beginners. Although it is worth the view of Dhauladhars that you get from the vantage point of the trek.\r\nTatta Pani trek is a trek to a hot water spring, it is not the same as the one near Shimla. The trek can be completed in a single day if you start early (2-3 hours uphill). However, it can get a little rough at the upper reaches. It is not a very scenic trek, and the only solace here is the hot water spring to take a dip into.\r\nMountain Biking\r\nThis is another adventure sport you can enjoy at Bir Billing or Palampur. There are various beautiful trails around that let you pass picturesque forests, temples, monasteries, hills, and villages.\r\nIn fact, you can even ride from Palampur to Bir. There are multiple tour facilitators for mountain biking, most of the paragliding operators provide mountain biking and trekking facilities too.\r\n \r\nHow To Reach Bir Billing\r\nFrom Dharamshala, the most convenient way to reach Bir Billing is by taxi. A four-seater cab will cost INR 1300 and will take a little over two hours to reach Bir.\r\nIf you are coming from Delhi, then Air, train and road routes are nearly the same for Palampur and Bir-Billing.\r\nBy Air\r\nThe nearest airport, Gaggal, is approximately 2 hrs of drive away (65 km) from Bir. You can make the onward journey either by bus or taxi. There are direct buses from Dharamshala to Bir but take much longer to reach, as compared to a taxi.\r\nThere are some connecting buses too, you can choose to take a bus from Dharamshala to either Palampur or Baijnath and then hop on to another bus from there to Bir.\r\nBy Train\r\nPathankot, the nearest train station from Bir is 144 km or approximately 4 hrs of drive away. The rest of the journey can be completed either by bus or taxi.\r\nOr train lovers with an extra amount of time at hand can enjoy the Kangra toy train from Pathankot to reach Bir. The Kangra valley narrow gauge train (also known as Pathankot – Jogindernagar toy train) stops at Ahju, which is 3 km away from Bir. The toy train journey takes about 7 hrs.\r\nBy Bus\r\nBoth private and state buses run from Majnu ka Tila, the Tibetan establishment in Delhi to Tibetan Colony (lower Bir). The journey takes 12-14 hours depending on weather, traffic and road conditions and tickets cost anything between 900-1300. \r\nBest Time to visit Bir Billing\r\nFor paragliding, the best time to visit Bir is either March – June or October – November.\r\nOtherwise, Bir billing stays pleasant throughout the year, and you can enjoy all of its seasons in its beauty. Avoid monsoon (July-September); the Dharamshala belt receives heavy rainfall, and paragliding close during this season.\r\nIf you would like to experience the surreal charm of gliding over the snow-covered mountains then visit the place in December – February.\r\nStay Options at Bir Billing\r\nWe didn’t stay over in Bir and made a day’s paragliding trip to Bir from Mcleodganj.\r\nHowever, you will find everything from small hotels, backpacker hostels, homestays and campsites to choose from. Big hotels and resorts are located a little away from the main village.\r\nAn HPTDC hotel, the Uhl (named after the Uhl river) is located nearly 15 km away from Bir and is considered one of the ideal places to spend a night in the area. The property is spacious, offers decent meals and has an old-world outlook in furnishings like most HPTDC hotels.\r\nA backpacker hostel, Zostel has a branch in Bir. It provides comfortable rooms, dorms, and activities to both solo travelers and group travelers. \r\nConclusion\r\nBir-Billing has a lot more to explore than just paragliding. It has beautiful vistas and trails to explore. Tibetan institutes and monasteries to indulge in some spirituality. And lots of natural beauty around to soak in.\r\n'),
(74, 'Bodh Gaya', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/65933080/Buddha.jpg?width=1200&height=900', 'Bodh Gaya Travelogue – A Journey into Self Enlightenment\r\n\r\n“Just before the full moon day of the month of Vesakha in about the year 528 BCE, a young ascetic of noble birth, worn out by years of self denial, arrived on the outskirts of the small village of Uruvela nestled on the banks of the sandy Neranjara River. Many years later he described the scene that unfolded before him. “There I saw a beautiful stretch of countryside, a beautiful grove, a clear flowing river, a lovely ford and a village nearby for support. And I thought to myself; ‘Indeed, this is a good place for a young man set on striving’ “. He settled himself under the spreading branches of the a nearby tree and prepared to begin his meditation. Just then a young woman named Sujata happened to be passing and noticing how thin he was, ran quickly home and brought him a bowel of milk rice and sweet honey. Strengthened by this nutritious meal the ascetic began his meditation. All night he sat there as the leaves of the tree quivered in the gentle breeze and the moon shone bright in the velvety black sky. Eventually the clouds of ignorance dissolved and he saw the Truth in all its glory and splendour. He was no longer Prince Siddhartha or the ascetic Gotama. He had become the Awakened One, the Compassionate One, the Light of the World, the Buddha Supreme.” (Source)\r\nTime went by and Uruvela grew to became the present day Gaya. The place where Gautama attained Bodhisatava is one of the most revered spots of Buddhism known as Bodh Gaya. Today, Bodh Gaya stands as one of the most popular places to visit in Bihar where Buddhists from all around the world come to pay their respects to The Great Buddha.\r\n\r\nBodh Gaya is also one of the most common picnic spots for the schools in Bihar. Doesn’t matter if the school is in Patna or in Darbhanga or in Bhagalpur, they always prefer Bodh Gaya when it comes to an outstation trip. The reason is simple, the amenities and facilities available in Bodh Gaya are better than most of the places of tourist interest in Bihar. Speaking of school trips, this was the reason why I was introduced to this place in the first place. In 2012, I worked at a school in Patna as a part time teacher who would fill in for any teacher who was absent. Their first school trip happened in Bodh Gaya and I was sent with the bunch of noisy kids. Thankfully, then there was no such thing as smartphones in the hands of children. Now when I look at the kids with smartphones clicking selfies, the kids of Bodh Gaya seem like angels.\r\n\r\nBodh Gaya felt like a place that was out of the world. A multi-cultural destination, where you’ll find visitors from every country in the world, especially those who follow Buddhism, that you only seen at places like Manali, Hampi or Goa. Bodh Gaya is a small world of its own.\r\n\r\nMy next solo Bodh Gaya trip happened in 2016, when I was doing a small monsoon trail of Bihar and I couldn’t find a place better than Gaya to make a stop. I took the early morning Jan Shatabdi Express form Patna and reached Gaya Junction at 8:30 AM. From Gaya Junction, I took a shared autorikshaw which dropped me outside Bodh Gaya. From here, I took a battery operated rikshaw finally reached the temple area.\r\n\r\nAs a well developed tourist spot, the number of places to stay in Bodh Gaya is not limited. You can find a room as per your budget and preferences. I checked into Hotel Sakura House which was right next to the beautiful Myanmar Monastery and its rooftop presented a lovely view of the whole area. The ascending cloud made the view even more gorgeous.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, I walked from my hotel and went to Mahabodhi Temple Complex. Mahabodhi Temple is the area where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. The space consists of all the seven spaces where Siddhartha Gautam meditated for one day each. This includes the evergreen and holy Mahabodhi Tree under which you’ll find many Buddhist Monks meditating.\r\n\r\nAmong the other important places to visit in Bodh Gaya, the giant Buddha Statue presents an encompassing view from the distance. I took a walk, clicked a few pictures, observed the crowd and then moved to another location. One of my favourite spots in Bodh Gaya has been recently constructed. The White Buddha statue is constructed in the style of Thailand’s White Temple. The place is simply beautiful. Its location is a little far from rest of the Bodh Gaya Monasteries so you’ll find less tourists here.\r\n\r\nI had my dinner at Fujia Green, one of the best restaurants in Bodh Gaya. The chicken fried rice was too huge in quantity and I had to pack the rest of it.\r\nNext morning I woke up and visited the many monasteries of Bodh Gaya. The Chinese Temple, The Japanese Pagoda, The Burmese Temple, The Bhutan Monastery are some of the most beautifully constructed monasteries in this Buddhist town. Each monastery has its own style of construction and represents that country’s signature architecture.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Pagoda in Bodh Gaya or Indosan Nippon Japanese Temple was built in the year 1972. Here you’ll find the preaching of Lord Buddha etched on the wall. A huge Japanese style bell gong is kept outside. The Royal Bhutan Monastery in Bodh Gaya is another beautiful place to visit. This temple has 7 feet high statue of Lord Buddha with many clay carvings. The Thai Monastery of Bodh Gaya dates back to the year 1956. Sloping and curved roof of the edifice is covered with golden tiles is an insignia of Thai architecture. Here, a 25 metre high statue of Lord Buddha stands above all.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of my Bodh Gaya solo trip, I moved to explore Rajgir and Nalanda. I returned to Bodh Gaya in Jan 2018 to celebrate Losar but I’ll leave that for another blog post.\r\n\r\nHow to reach Bodh Gaya – Bodh Gaya is easily accessible from Delhi, Mumbai and other cities of India. Trains for Gaya ply regularly on this route and will drop you at the junction from where you can catch a shared auto-rikshaw for Bodh Gaya.\r\nYou can also mix Bodh Gaya trip with Varanasi. Trains from Banaras go directly to Gaya and they take 3 hours to reach. You can spend a day or try to return the same day.\r\nBodh Gaya is mysterious, intriguing, enthralling because Bodh Gaya is nothing like whatever you have heard about Bihar. And this place is an apt introduction to start your journey because Bihar is nothing like what you have heard about Bihar.\r\n'),
(75, 'Bodh Gaya', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/65933080/Buddha.jpg?width=1200&height=900', 'Frankly, it was quite embarrassing, given the fact that I was born and brought up in Bihar, to shake my head in negation every time someone asked me whether I have been to Bodhgaya. No longer able to withstand those amused accusing eyes, one fine morning I donned my traveler’s hat and hopped on a train and set out for Bihar.\r\nBihar has a rich history of panoramic culture, colorful tradition and diverse religious beliefs. Some of the greatest kings and dynasties in India ruled over the gargantuan empire of Magadh - Ashoka the Great, Changragupta Maurya, Vikramaditya, to name a few. But it is Bodhgaya, one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage centers in the world that has put Bihar on the world map.\r\nMy trip to Bodhgaya was only of 24 hours but nevertheless it was an enriching experience; mentally and spiritually. Bodhgaya is the place where Gautam Buddha, the spiritual leader of the Buddhism, is said to have attained supreme knowledge meditating under an obscure banyan tree (now one of the world’s most known and worshipped tree). Not wasting any tme, I made haste to some of the iconic places in Bodhgaya.\r\nThe Mahabodhi Temple: The Mahabodhi Temple is as much an architectural marvel as it is a sacrosanct place of pilgrimage. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and I could see why. The place exudes waves of spiritual energy. I was dumbfounded. Never had I thought that a non-believer like me could be an awe of the Temple and feel the celestial energy flow like an unobstructed river. Built by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka, the Temple also has a diamond throne shrine with a canopy supported by four pillars over a stone representation of the Vajrasana, the Seat of Enlightenment. The Temple is home to a leviathan black statue of Lord Buddha, sitting cross-legged and his right hand touching the earth. The Temple is open from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.\r\nThe Bodhi Tree: The moment I came out of the spell put on me by the Mahabodhi Temple, I happily walked into the clutches of another powerful spell. This time the Bodhi Tree - the place where Lord Buddha is said to have meditated and gained  supreme knowledge. The legend states that for seven days after  enlightenment, Lord Buddha continued to meditate under the now sacred Bodhi Tree without so much as shifting from his posture. During the second week, Lord Buddha practiced walking meditation. To commemorate this, a jewel walk, Chankramanar, was built as a low platform adorned with 19 lotuses which are parallel to the Maha Bodhi Temple.\r\nA stupa called Animesh Lochan Chaitya was built to objectify the legend that Lord Buddha contemplated the Bodhi Tree for a week in gratification without once blinking his eyes.\r\nSeveral countries with a Buddhist population like Japan, Burma, Sri Lanka, Korea, and Nepal have erected their own respective monasteries and temples in Bodhgaya. The diversity in architecture brought about by this phenomenon is nothing short of amazing.\r\nWhile rushing through all the sites, I decided that the journey would not be complete if I did not make a stop at one of the much praised Buddhist meditation institutes in Bodhgaya. I was particularly impressed by the Root Institute. People from all over the world belonging to any religion can study and meditate on Buddha\'s teachings as they are explained in the Tibetan Mahayana tradition. The institute offers various courses from October to March every winter, both for the amateurs and the practiced.\r\nThe time constraint was playing on my mind as I had to catch the return train to Delhi. There were places that I wanted to see but could not. For you, my fellow travelers, my suggestion would be to dedicate at least a couple of days to explore, understand, and feel the spirituality and the innate peace that Bodhgaya brings to the soul.\r\n');

(76, 'Bodh Gaya', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/65933080/Buddha.jpg?width=1200&height=900', 'We woke early for our cycle towards Bodh Gaya in Bihar state. But breakfast on the balcony was not as planned since it was raining again, not a good omen. By the time we actually loaded up the bikes ready to push them up and out of the labyrinth of lanes in the old city the rain was just lightly drizzling and all the mud and various droppings in the lanes meant we had to be really careful.\r\n\r\nWe had just got out of the lanes and were cycling along the wet street when I looked up to see Robin screeching on the brakes swerving and falling and a very small Indian man go flying through the air, landing about 2 metres away in the muddy street. Luckily nobody was hurt but the little Indian guy was completely covered in mud, again another omen. We picked ourselves up and made it to the river where we managed to follow a local guy on a bike and cross the railway bridge, despite the fact that it was supposed to be closed for vehicles and we had been warned that we should take the ferry. On the other side the road was still a mess and our progress was slow despite the flatness of the terrain. Robin kept saying “oh it’s easy” but I was not agreeing. I could not figure it out, but I was in a bad mood and of course could not manage to keep up with Robin despite him saying he was not going fast. A couple of hours later Robin again crashed, however this time skidding into a stray dog on the wet muddy road.\r\n\r\nWe had been hesitant in general about cycling into Bihar. It is the poorest sate in India and famous for crime and dacoits. After reading about the many corruptions, caste warfare and banditry in the state I had told Robin I would never cycle there, and yet here we were. The chief minister of the state has been found guilty of all kinds of criminal charges, and when he was forced to stand down temporarily because of corruption, he replaced himself with his illiterate wife! Add to this that everyone will tell you Bihar is “very backwards place” and is notorious for armed robberies and naxalite violence. We were well on track to be safely in a hotel by nightfall and the people we met on the way all seemed very nice. No aggression at all, just staring. We found the cheapest ever lunch we have had on the trip; 12 rupees for a thali of rice, 2 veg, and daal. The guys at the dhaba were very friendly and watched with amusement as we got out our rain jackets and ordered a chai to delay setting off into the rain which had then become quite heavy.\r\n\r\nBy the time we arrived in Sasaram I was really tired the road had become totally clogged with trucks and buses. They were building the bypass for the town but in the mean time everything was still piling straight through into the mess of potholes and mud with their horns blaring. What a dump we thought. We found a crappy mosquito filled hotel which did at least have a nice manager and I collapsed under the mosquito netting. Robin set about straight away cleaning all the mud that had encased itself around the gears and we prayed that it would stop raining and the roads would improve. After getting dinner that night though I realised that something was wrong and fell asleep not feeling very well. I had a bad night not helped by the constantly running generator and trucks blasting their horns just outside our window. In the morning we realised that I was too ill to cycle, Giardia parasite had hit again and I had the runs and a nasty bloated feeling, Robin felt ok but had no trouble sleeping and later that afternoon realised that he too was suffering giardia.\r\n\r\nAfter a rest and a trip to the chemists we set off away from the terrible main road. We found a fantastic old Afghani ruler’s tomb set in a park in the middle of a lake. Unfortunately the foreigner price was going to be more than what we were spending on accommodation for the day so we just sat inside the park and enjoyed the trees and the beautiful setting. All around the fences of the park people stopped giggling and waving at us, I think hardly any tourists go to Bihar because of its reputation, but the people there were lovely and friendly and we enjoyed our little walk about town. Farms stretched right into the town and many animals wandered around. We managed to stop every cricket game we passed and soon had a massive flowing of children all excitedly running behind us, but we were enjoying ourselves too. We decided to cook plain potatoes and eggs for ourselves that night and were again surprised by the cheapness of the food.\r\n\r\nThe next day we forced ourselves onto the bikes and set off on the long ride to Bodh Gaya, we figured it would be a lot nicer being sick there than in Sasaram. The cycle there was harder than it should have been because of our stomachs and tiredness and also there were quite a lot of road works but it was at least not raining. The bright sunshine and heat were fairly punishing, but at least the road was flat. Very flat. Bihar is like Holland in India, pancake flat and intensely green, and everywhere there is water between the fields, in the fields, on vacant plots of land right next to houses. No wonder there were so many mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nWe arrived late in Bodh Gaya after an 85 mile ride in our weakened states and it was dark before we finally managed to find Shanti Guest House. We had not been helped in finding a hotel by the many touts who ran ahead of us trying to claim commission from the hotel for “bringing us to them” This was very annoying but more so was the refusal of at least 3 different hotels to let our bikes into the room. We have never left our bikes outside of a locked room in India and we were not about to start in Bihar.\r\n\r\nWe were laid up in Bodh Gaya for a week, we both had bad giardia and no energy to move around and no appetite for food either. Bodh Gaya would have just been another small rural village in Bihar had it not also been the site where The Buddha became enlightened sitting under a Bodhi tree. The village now hosts thousands of pilgrims and tourists each month, it had many different temples, hotels and restaurants from all the different cultures that Buddhism has reached all over the world. We really enjoyed visiting the different temples particularly those from Thailand, Tibet and Bhutan. The artwork was colourful had simple lines and gave lovely atmospheres inside these temples.\r\n\r\nMost other western tourists we met seemed to be Buddhists themselves but we ended up being too ill to spend much time finding out about Buddhism. We visited the famous Bodhi Tree and were able to touch it and feel the very powerful energy of the place. It was nice to sit quietly in the gardens around the main temple and watch what seemed to be a constant stream of people from all over Asia coming there in pilgrimage. There were Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Sri Lankans, Chinese, Nepalese, and Burmese.\r\n\r\nThe illness break meant that we were in Bodh Gaya for the festival of Holi. This is the Hindu festival of colour. We had been warned that things were going to get a little bit crazy, and that on no account should we be on the bikes during the festival. The main problem we had at that time was trying to figure out when the festival was, because the length of time given for the festivities seemed to vary from 2 days to a whole week. In fact for the days running up to Holi we saw many pink and green-faced children running around Also many guys were wearing their Holi clothes, which already had huge stains of dye on them from previous years it seems.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Holi everyone seemed to have fireworks and there were bonfires all over the village with fire dancers all around them. Over the next 2 days most businesses shut down and a fair bit of drinking was done, this is quite unusual in India where alcohol is frowned upon and Indian society shows its disdain for the drink by naming (or is that blaming) the booze shops “ English wine shop”! Unfortunately we were too ill to join the riverside puja (worship ceremony).\r\n\r\nThe next day we ventured out of the hotel with trepidation hoping not to be attacked too badly by people throwing paint. We had breakfast in the one cheaper restaurant that remained open through the holiday and afterwards decided to go for a walk to the giant Buddha statue. There the fun started and a group of excited youths yelling “Can I give you colour” didn’t wait for an answer before tipping a bottle of blue dye over me. I lost my sense of humour and wrestled the bottle from him, much to his delight. Then the spirit of the day entered me and I realised that \r\nI would be a terrible sport not to just go with the flow and smile. We were rewarded with many smiles from locals all day for wearing colour like them. Mostly we were not involved with many fights that took place in the name of giving colour. Most locals politely asked to give us colour on our faces but the worse incident was from a group of Israeli tourists armed with pump action colour guns. My shirt is now permanently stained in big pink splashes and it took a lot of scrubbing over a few days to get the colours from our skin.\r\n\r\nWith the illness delay we finally made the decision to take a train to Calcutta (Kolkata). So it was with a little regret but also with some relief on my part that we booked our ticket on the Doon Express to Kalkota. I tried to console Robin that at least we had stopped cycling in a place beginning with B! -we have now done “Banchory to Bodh Gaya by Bike”.\r\n\r\nOn the day we had to leave to cycle the 15 km to Gaya station I was not feeling too well again, but determined to get the train we cycled very slowly through the rural countryside and arrived at the fairly hectic Gaya Station. We wheeled our bikes to the parcel office. We had been told all we needed to do was turn up one hour before the train and book in our luggage. We had 4 hours until the scheduled departure of our train, but 2 hours later we had just managed to get the staff to accept our bikes. The whole process was really quite stressful and we now realise that all the difficulties the staff were claiming were an elaborate attempt to get baksheesh for actually doing their job. It took us threatening to camp out for days in their parcel office until we actually saw our bikes getting on a train. We were definitely not going to get on a train without seeing that our bikes were also on there. A helpful local businessman asked Robin what we had been trying to do and replied to him by saying “just give them 50 rupees, this is India, everyone is beggar!”\r\n\r\nWe had a plan; we would be at the back of the train to supervise the loading of our bikes and then just jump on the train wherever and walk down it to find our berths. The first sight of the train arriving (already 3 hours late) and the crowds of people surging towards it trying to get on soon made us realise it was not going to be that simple. There was no way anyone was going to be able to walk along inside the train. Our carriage was the first one behind the engine and the luggage was at the rear of the train, some 25 carriages back. Robin bravely loaded up his body with all 4 panniers and his large rucksack and began to waddle towards the front of the train. He would not actually get on until I had run to the front with news that the bikes were on too. In the end, despite all the luggage staff’s warning that there might not be room, the bikes were easily loaded and I began the mad dash weighed down by bags to the front of the train. I passed the unreserved seating carriage to see people wedged in place worse than sardines. Masses of humanity were bulging out of carriages at every opening. Thank God we had a reservation. A minute before the train pulled out I found Robin and we managed to jump aboard being careful not to trample the many people crammed in every available space all over the floor.\r\n\r\nOur berths in the sleeper car were still vacant and carefully we managed to install ourselves in the cramped space. We watched another Indian couple go through their preparations for the night. They clearly had done this before and had come prepared with bedrolls and blow up pillows. The guy beside us managed to fit comfortably into his bunk even with two big bags wedged at his feet. When we tried to fit into our bunks the couple opposite could not help laughing at how big we were. They had managed to fit 2 people and a big bag onto one bunk. We had to crush ourselves in with one big backpack for a pillow and our feet stuck out into the aisle. Still once we were installed I managed to sleep reasonably well. Robin however was kept awake by the train’s horn, which was constantly blaring. In fact train drivers in India use their horns even more then the bus and truck drivers. We travelled about 450 km in 9 hours, our train was 3 hours late, but finally we got to Kalkota and our bikes arrived with us without too much damage either. It only took about 1 hour of paperwork to get the luggage department to release our bikes.\r\n\r\nWe had thought that taking a train was the easy option. In the end the experience was stressful and not that fast either, but we were not sure that Robin’s bike would have been up to the 4 day ride without some new parts. Our stomachs were definitely not up to it, so the train was the right decision and we planned to spend a few days in Kolkata to recover form our illnesses fully and figure out what to do next.\r\n'),

Then again, it depends upon the weather conditions you enjoy the most. If you are looking for an escape from the scorching heat during summer months (April-June), you will love to drive along the airy, hilly roads here.\r\nIf monsoon showers are your thing and you are looking for a romantic getaway, visit Dharamshala during July, August or September. Post monsoons (October-November), you can dodge the heavy rains as well as enjoy trekking and other activities because the weather is pleasant during the day with chilly nights. The winter months are freezing here, so if you are a fan of snow-covered mountains and snowfalls, this is the best time for you to be in Dharamshala.\r\nONE DAY IN DHARAMSHALA ITINERARY\r\nFollow this guide and make the most of your trip even if you’re short on time. These are the top sights and things to do during your one day in Dharamshala.\r\nEarly Morning Spiritual Awakening\r\nDharamshala is home to various Buddhist monasteries and a visit to one of them first thing in the morning would make for a wonderful start to your day. Visit the Dalai Lama Complex, the Namgyalma Stupa, or the Tsechokling Gompa to experience the meditative and spiritual soul that is Dharamshala.\r\nThe monasteries are open from 6am to 6pm from November to March, and 7am to 5pm from April to October. Not only do you get to observe the beautiful architecture of the monasteries, but you also experience a mesmerizing sunrise from the top.\r\nWar Memorial Garden\r\nHead over to the historic War memorial garden after your morning ritual at the monasteries. 9am is the perfect time to visit this location, and it is easy to reach since it is located near the main bus stand next to Dharamshala College.

Pay respects to the martyrs of war whose names are inscribed onto the walls of the building.\r\nInternational Cricket Stadium\r\nSituated close to the war memorial garden is the cricket stadium that has caught many a tourist’s eye due to its brilliant and unique design and architecture. It could well be the most beautiful cricket stadium in India.\r\nLunch Break\r\nNow that it’s time for a little pit stop for refilling your system for the rest of the day, take a break at any of the cafes located in the main town area. Don’t forget to enjoy the special Thupka found only in Dharamshala, which is a unique dish of momos dipped in a thick, spicy soup. There are many cafes and restaurants located near the monasteries as well, which makes it easier to stop and grab a quick bite if you choose.\r\nRetreat at Bhagsu Nag Temple\r\nNext up is the visit to a Lord Shiva temple in Dharamshala known as Bhagsu Nag Temple. Not only is this temple a popular tourist destination due to its religious importance and stunning architecture, it garners praise because of the fresh water spring of Bhagsu waterfall that flows through the hill near the shrine.\r\nThe local legend about this temple is an interesting one that you can discover by visiting it and hearing it from the words of a dweller of Dharamshala. During the monsoon, it is rather enjoyable to visit the Bhagsu waterfall as it gives an incredible experience and you can get some beautiful photographs. An afternoon can be easily spent admiring the beauty of this place.\r\nLate Afternoon Church Visit\r\nThe famous St. John’s Church in Dharamshala is another one of its marvelous tourist attractions. Perched carefully within the wilderness, St. John’s Church has a neo-Gothic construction that has given it a good reputation amongst tourists. The church easily stands out even within a thick forest grove, and not only is it a spiritually awakening destination, it is also in a peaceful and gorgeous environment to keep tourists calm and relaxed while enjoying the area.\r\nEarly Evening Lake Trails\r\nThe Dal Lake is situated very close to St. John’s Church, so a lakeside walk or moment of resting can be taken advantage of. Spend around 30 minutes or more admiring the beauty of the Dal Lake before venturing into the evening hours of the trip. The Dal Lake is another one of the most popular tourist spots of Dharamshala that shouldn’t be missed.\r\nSunset in bazaar\r\nThe evening bazaar in Dharamshala is to die for.

So, I planned a 3 day trip to Dharamshala, and the first thing I looked for was how to get there. Not a bus, not a train, but a flight. I found only one airline that served this route, and that was Air Deccan. Booking a month in advance, I got 2 return tickets for Rs. 9000, out of which more than Rs. 5000 was the tax component. In this case, if you are going to Dalhousie or Pathankot or Dharamshala and want to go by air, then book in advance since the ticket price shoots up drastically as you reach the desired journey date (in my case, when I enquired around 15 days before the flight about re-scheduling, I was told that the ticket had gone up to Rs. 29000).\r\nSo, any plans of changing the journey date were abandoned, and I got a bit busy in asking people about the place and places to see, and about the weather, and so on (this mind you, after I had already been there in college on a visit with friends). Once I learned some information (none of which I used to any great degree), it was time to head to Delhi Airport. The flight was late by 30 minutes, par for the course. And then the bus took around 20 of us to … we can’t be going in that small plane !!! .. it was, for the first time in my life, I would be traveling in a turbo-prop plane, and seeing the propellers rotating instead of the pleasure of a normal jet. The feeling wasn’t entirely too pleasant, but the flight was decent. Another thing I never cared to find out was whether this was a direct flight; it wasn’t. It first headed to Pathankot, and after a 15 minute stop, headed off to the Gaggal airport. This was a very small airport, and I think the flight I landed on was the only flight that comes there, and there were a lot of security over there waving big automatic weapons, so I did not try taking a photo of the airport :-).\r\nWe negotiated with the taxis, but there is apparently a union, and for a journey of around 30 minutes to the Club Mahindra Resort of Kangra Valley, none of them was willing to take less than Rs. 300. Eventually we gave in, and took a taxi. The journey was as we expected, on narrow roads resplendent with lush greenery on either side (due to it being the rainy season), and we finally reached Club Mahindra around 1:30 in the afternoon. After a quick lunch and a short break, we took a taxi from the Resort with a pre-planned package for the First day.\r\nThe package was to cover the destinations of Dal Lake, some high point, St. John’s Church, the Dalai Lama Temple, Mcleodganj market, Bhagsunath temple and waterfalls, the War memorial, another Devi temple in Dharamshala (in the valley) and that was about it, for a princely sum of Rs. 800. We did not try much negotiating because we were told that these were standard rates.\r\nAnd off we headed. First we went to Dal Lake; not so good. It was all muddy and we decided to head on, climbing up in the hills till we came to a point called Neddi’s point. It was all mist and clouds over there, and the air felt nice.\r\nWe walked around a bit, and then headed off to Mcleodganj. First off we reached this ancient Church called Church of St. John’s in the Wilderness, established in a Gothic style in 1852, and in need of repairs. The settings within its set of trees was incredible, and the whole area around it was oh-so-green. We stayed for some time, put some money in the box for donations for repairs, and then headed on.\r\nWe reached Bhagsunath temple next, and it was a nice temple, with a plaque bearing the fact that it was the ceremonial temple for the First Gorkha Rifles until they moved out of Dharamshala.\r\nThen we had a choice; it was getting around 5 PM and we could either head off to the falls or to the Dalai Temple (closes at 6 PM). I took the command decision of where to go with the approval of my spouse :-), and off we went to the Temple. It was so serene and beautiful, and we could see normally boisterous children also piping down a bit. There were a set of monks meditating, and a dog sleeping right next to them. The conservationist in me was thrilled to see the solar water heating apparatus in the temple. We did not get a chance to see the Dalai Lama since he was not in the location at that point of time.\r\n \r\nAfter spending time over there, we headed in a steep path downhill (thanks to the knowledge of our taxi driver), and visited a Devi’s temple in the valley below (and there was almost nobody there except for a couple of locals); we rounded off the first day by visiting the war memorial, setup to honor the armed forces.\r\nAnd then we were pretty tired, so had some nice grub and then zzz land.\r\n'),

He applied the condition that his ‘lingam’ should be carried without keeping it on earth even once.

Also considered as Mini Goa of our country, it is an ideal holiday destination to chill and relax.\r\n\r\nDAMAN & DIU: DIFFERENCE\r\nHowever what percentage of you actually is aware of the fact that Daman and Diu are literally two separate places? Popularly known as Daman and Diu are actually two different locations clubbed in one Union territory and are approximately 650 kms away from each other. Let’s find out together a lot of such interesting facts concerning this place.\r\nABOUT DIU\r\nSituated in the southern coast of Gujarat, Diu is a beautiful island and a very popular destination for Gujarati folks as Alcohol is legal here. Notable for its stunning beaches spread all over the island, Diu is a home of serenity which has started attracting the travel enthusiasts from all over the country.\r\nAs soon as you enter this eccentric island, be rest assured to bid farewell to the hustle bustle of the city life. Much calmer, serene and clean, this attractive island has plenty of things to surprise you.\r\nNormally a couple of days tour is enough to explore the beautiful destinations of the Island. Most of the tourist spots are located at the closest proximity, making the trip so much more fun and convenient. Let’s take a glimpse at the top 5 places that one must visit when in Diu.\r\n#1 NADIA CAVES\r\nAn absolute favorite spot of the photographers, nature lovers and artistic minds, Nadia caves is the ultimate choice to get pleasure from some solitary blissfulness. One may love to spend hours and hours in these naturally formed caves, enjoying the sunrays and stone structures. Additionally, this place is a massive hit for the pre-wedding shoots and if you are one of those who loves to change your Instagram pics quite often, then this place is simply for you.\r\nOne of its own kind, these beautiful caves are the true depiction of natural beauty with many picturesque spots. As shortly as you enter these humungous rocky caves, you would find signboards showing directions that helps the tourists to not stray in these caves.\r\nYou may also experience a dip in the temperature inside, making it a comfortable location throughout the day. There is no entry fees or restrictive visiting hours, however, it is sensible to depart the location before sunset keeping one’s safety in mind.\r\nYou may not find many food stalls outside the caves and can enjoy the fresh lime soda or coconut water along with few eatables including chips and few fruits. Unlike many other caves in the country, I really found these caves clean and less crowded which allures the visitors the most.\r\n#2 NAGOA BEACH\r\nThe most well-liked beach in the town, it is a perfect place to get dabbled in the clean water. One end of the beach, however, has many huge rocks on its shore making the swimming experience a little dangerous. The beach has gorgeous soft sands tempting you to get your hands dirty and creating some sand castles or carelessly playing with your kids experiencing a serene connection with nature.\r\nA gorgeous beach with lots of fun activities to fancy, it is the prime attraction of Diu and is enclosed by many beautiful resorts, small eating joints and shopping stalls displaying the beach wears, balls and toys for the children.\r\nThe beach is mostly loved by the guests for a romantic stroll watching the sun to descend so beautifully. In addition, it is the hub of water sports activities including parasailing, banana rides, and water scooters.\r\nBeach Festival – Festa De Diu\r\nDuring the months of Dec to Feb, a cultural beach festival is held on the beach of Nagoa which is popularly known as Festa de Diu. The beach gets amazingly flooded by the travellers around this time and one may enjoy a luxurious stay at the beautiful tents.\r\nCultural programs including dance performances and live concerts are the prime attractions of this fest making it a worthful experience. Everything around it looks so colorful, vibrant and full of life that leaves you awestruck for many days.\r\n#3 SHELL MUSEUM\r\nUsually, museums do not attract the young crowd these days, but the shell museum of Diu can totally blow your mind if you pay a visit there. Owned by an ex-merchant navy captain, it is a wonderful creation of Captain Devjibhai Vira Fulbaria.\r\nHis passion to collect the undersea beauties gave birth to this unique museum giving a delightful experience to its visitors. With a beautiful collection of shells and undersea species, this small place would make you think of the efforts put together to create this amazing assortment.\r\nPhotography inside the museum is strictly prohibited which is fine as sometimes one should enjoy the moment. The museum is just 2 km away from the Nagoa beach and opens between 10:30 am to 5 pm and has an entry fee of Rs 20.\r\n#4 DIU FORT\r\nBuilt by the Portuguese in 1535, the fort is another example of great architecture and the human mind. Surrounded by the Arabian sea by three sides, it is an exquisite tourist spot for photo enthusiasts and history lovers. The Fort accommodates a lighthouse which is also the highest point of the city and three small yet beautiful churches.\r\nThe view from the lighthouse is spectacular and is the showstopper of the show. One may love to take a glance at the ancient cannons scattered here and there inside the Fort wondering about the Era these were used in. With an ample amount of picturesque views, the Fort conjointly includes a small garden to laze around.\r\nThe Fort can be visited between 7 am to 12 pm and again from 2 pm to 5 pm every day.\r\nDo’s and Don’ts\r\nIt is advisable to wear comfortable shoes while throughout the Fort visit as one could expect a lot of walking inside.\r\nAlso, it would be a good idea to carry a water bottle to quench your thirst as you would not find anything inside the Fort. Although, there are few local food stalls available outside the Fort selling coconut water, aerated drinks, and fresh lime water along with delicious vada paos and pakoras to satisfy your hunger.\r\nAdditionally, one must carry an umbrella or hat to avoid the scorching heat.\r\n#5. ST PAUL’S CHURCH\r\nInfluenced by the Portuguese architecture, the church has some beautiful wooden carvings done inside that is an absolute delight for the eyes. Not in a very good condition though, it demands quick maintenance today but surely reminds us about the gorgeous churches of Goa.\r\nOne part of the church also has a school and a small garden. Few meters away from this church is The Church of St Francis of Assisi, whose one section has been turned as a hospital and St Thomas Church which is a museum now.\r\n#6. NANI DAMAN FORT\r\nNani Daman Fort occupies an area of 12,250 sq. metres. Its construction, begun by the Portuguese Viceroy to India -Dom Jeronimo de Azevedo in 1614 AD, took over fifty years to complete.\r\nLovely sculpture of Saint Jerome (lived 347-420 A.D.). Appropriately pictured here with a book, probably the Bible, in his hand, Saint Jerome was a learned man who wrote many theological works and translated the Bible from Hebrew into Latin.\r\nOTHER ATTRACTIONS\r\nGANGESHWAR TEMPLE is an ancient Shiva temple which has five naturally formed Shiva lings. No matter how astonishing it may sound, but the fact is these Shiva lings are formed in such a location that gets a daily wash by the sea waves itself.\r\nINS KUKRI MEMORIAL is the war memorial created in the memory of the brave naval soldiers those got martyred in the 1971 war against Pakistan. The unfortunate sinking of INS Kukri is still remembered by the people of Diu. The place has a model of the naval ship placed there along with a foundation stone on which the name of the martyrs is engraved. The memorial is located on a hill rock and is an excellent place to enjoy the sunset and spectacular sea view.\r\nJALANDHAR BEACH is another popular destination in Diu, known for its sunset viewpoint and sheer beauty.\r\nFUDAM BIRD SANCTUARY is one of the beautiful bird-watching spots in Diu which is a home of Flamingos, spoonbills, and many migratory birds. If you are one of those who loves to embrace the mother nature then, the early morning visit to one of these spots would give you mesmerizing views of birds playing, dancing and getting ready to fetch their food.\r\nBEST ROUTE TO REACH\r\nDiu has a beautiful airport making it so convenient for its visitors to reach. If you flying from Mumbai, it merely takes an hour to reach this beautiful destination. However, one could also drive down from Ahmedabad airport which would take nearly 7 and a half hours to cover a distance of approximately 353 km.\r\nAs we had a plan to visit the famous Shiva temple “Somnath” before heading for a relaxing tour of Diu, we started our road journey around 9 in the morning covering a distance of 336 km (from Dhrangdra) and reached Somanth around 3:30 in the noon.\r\nThe roads connectivity was pretty good which made our journey really comfortable. Post our Somnath darshan, we started for Diu and completed our journey in just 2 hours.\r\nAlternatively, one could choose a train journey and get down at Una (Gujarat) railway station which is just 12 km away from Diu.\r\nBEST TIME TO VISIT\r\nAlthough December to February is the time when a lot of cultural festivals like Runn of Kutch festival in Bhuj and Festa de Diu (Diu) are organized and thus are the most preferred months by the travellers. The island can be visited throughout the year however summers and winters are the preferable seasons by the travellers. The most preferred months\r\nFOOD AND ACCOMMODATION\r\nDiu has some amazing restaurants serving delicious kinds of seafood with a range of prawns and fish dishes. An evening walk near the seaside can take you to the countless food stalls with lip-smacking street foods and non-veg dishes to taste.\r\nAs alcohol consumption is legal in this place, you may get amazed by the number of bars the city has. However, do not even think of carrying the liquor bottles along with you in your return journey as strict security checking is done at the exit way of the Island.\r\nOne may find plenty of good hotels inside the city making it convenient for travel enthusiasts to visit its prominent attractions which are very close to each other. To enjoy the stay at exotic resorts, one could head towards Nagoa beach where the bunch of fine resorts is located.\r\nGENERAL DO’S & DONT’S\r\nJust like Goa, Diu also allows its travellers to enjoy a cycle or scooter ride and provides them on rent. With a refundable security deposit of 500 – 1000 Rs, the vehicles can be available on rent just for Rs 20 to Rs 50 per day, and scooters for Rs 150 to Rs 200 per day.\r\nIt is most advisable to travel back to your hotels before its too dark as there aren’t any restriction on alcohol consumption on the beach which may not be likable by many, particularly those who are travelling with their families.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY & CONCLUSION\r\nDiu is one of the least populated places in India with gorgeous natural beauties all around. Its glorious beaches and historical monuments are so inviting and smitten with the tranquillity that acts almost like a therapy. The naturally formed caves, the beach festival, and mystical temples are few added treasures that can be cherished throughout your Diu trip.\r\nDiu is a perfect holiday destination for somebody who loves to stay connected with nature and get charged up for a new day. In simple language, this place is just like Goa but in a calmer and less crowded way.\r\n');

(81, 'Diu', 'https://www.tourmyindia.com/weekend-tours/images/ahmedabad-diu-weekend-tour2.webp', 'Diu Travel Blog: Solo travel on Diu Island\r\nBy Ankita\r\nInformation about Diu on the World Wide Web is woefully inadequate. But as I discovered in just 24 hours, this welcoming little seaside hamlet is full of serene gems and beautiful sights. And their story deserves to be told.\r\nI landed in Diu at 2pm on Republic Day (26th January), uncertain about the time I’d have here, as a solo woman traveller. I left at 2pm the next day, wishing I could spend another night listening to the roar of its pristine sea.\r\nMy Diu Travel Blog\r\nArriving in Diu\r\nFesta De Diu was putting me up in one of their luxury sea-view tents and I boarded the mini Air India flight from Mumbai to Diu looking forward to a day of solitude and introspection. But I had totally overlooked the fact that it was Republic Day. Several detailed security checks and a 45-minute delay later, I finally landed on the shores of Ilha de Calma (Isle of Calm). My worst fears were confirmed when there was no one outside the little airport to pick me up. After a flurry of calls and a short wait, a car drew up in front of the waiting area and a smiling driver came out to apologise for the delay. Suitably pacified, I bid goodbye to the tuk-tuk I’d been photographing and the gracious guards, and embarked on my Diu adventure.\r\nFesta de Diu: My beautiful tent!\r\nDiu Village, constructed by the tourism authorities just for Festa de Diu, a two and a half month long cultural festival at Nagoa Beach, was situated a mere 5 minutes away from the airport. I arrived famished and was ushered to tent no 27 right away. From the outside, it didn’t look like much. In fact, the entire settlement wore a deserted look and I wondered where all the visitors were. But once inside my tent, I was completely awed. The space, decor and the amenities – they were all as world-class as the website promised. Take a look.\r\nAll I wanted was to lay down my bags and soak in the feel of this wonderful luxury tent and the bright winter sea beyond its flapping exteriors. But lunch time was nearly at an end (it was 3pm) and so I made my way to the dining area, another tent-style set-up a 2 minute walk away. The folks at reception will insist on calling you a golf cart for every little trip but hey, a little walk never hurt anyone! I for one prefer to rely on my own two feet and I didn’t take these carts even once.\r\nLunch at Diu Village\r\nThe dining area was large and airy, with a lovely view of the sea on one side. However, once again, it wore a slightly derelict look. However the bar area looked shiny and well attended to. My meal plan did not include starters; so I opted for mains with steamed rice and tandoori roti, garden salad, roasted papad and gulab jamun for dessert. It being Republic Day, I assumed that the bar would be shut but they were serving alcohol (that’s chargeable too). But I assumed I’d find a wine shop nearby (how wrong I was!) and passed the drinks menu.\r\nThe portions were excellent and so was the quality of the ingredients used but the dishes themselves left a little to be desired. The curry was runny instead of thick and the salad was rudimentary. But I was hungry and I enjoyed the meal all the same.\r\nWalking around Nagoa Beach\r\nFor that day, there were two events scheduled – a dance performance at 7PM and a live band gig 8PM onwards. It was 4:30 PM by the time and I decided to walk around the area before sundown. On the way here, I’d spotted several interesting sights I planned to inspect at close quarters.\r\nThe weather was positively poetic when I stepped out – cool and breezy with a lovely stillness in the air. There was not a single soul to be seen all along my walk down the alley that connects Diu Village to the main Nagoa Beach area. A couple of red wattled lapwings greeted me around the corner and seemed quite unafraid of humans, as they stayed in place even when I ventured really close.\r\nFriendly locals with colourful wares lined the entire length of the street adjoining the beach. The adults and children alike were happy to pose for my amateur lens; one vendor was eager to have me photograph every one of his wares! They sold snacks, cold drinks, corn on the cob, pistachio fruits, some clothing and tea. But I didn’t see a single wine shop. I did see a board announcing bikes on rent from government-approved lenders.\r\nNagoa Beach is one of the most popular coastal strips in Diu and the place teemed with families and children. It being Republic Day, a bunch of cheery children had built a cluster of sand castles topped with the tricolour.\r\nOne can try a variety of adventure sports on the beach as well, such as boat riding, hot air ballooning and bungee jumping. I was struck by how clean and blue the water was, contrary to some articles. After an hour of walking around, I returned to Diu Village and was sorely disappointed to learn that the 7pm show had been cancelled. Festa de Diu was more power-packed in December but now at the fag end of January, it seemed like there wasn’t much to do. I was momentarily stumped – it was too late to tour Diu city and I had no alcohol to while away the time with. And then I realised that I could simply watch the sun descend over the serene Diu horizon outside my tent.\r\nDusk at Diu Village\r\nWith nothing much to do until dinner time, I relaxed in my tent, played some music on the television (the volume is really low though, so as not to disturb other inhabitants I suppose) and made myself a cup of coffee using the kettle and coffee kit. Thus refreshed, I stepped out with my camera to capture the stunning sunset – its colours and purview as unadulterated and full-bodied as can be.\r\nDinner and live concert\r\nAt around 8pm, I had a sumptuous dinner of mushroom cream soup, paneer in tomato gravy, tandoori roti, garden salad, roasted papad and a much needed can of beer. The paneer was much better than the curry I’d had for lunch and I was left licking my fingers for every last morsel! The beer put me in just the right mood for some peppy performances by Raaga Trippin, a six-member band that specialises in Bollywood acapella mash-ups.\r\nThe night was chilly as I made my way to the open-air stage area and I was glad I’d brought my shawl. The air reverberated with music and cheers and it was hard not to smile, even though I was all by myself. The stage was extremely well set-up with excellent light and sound effects and a rapt audience hooted and sang along with the band singers.\r\nA closer look at them made me realise that they’d been on the same flight as me! As the night grew darker, the singers encouraged us to get up and shake a leg but the floor was dominated by men dancing in a style that is best described as ‘tapori’! I can’t think of an apt English translation but Google it and you’ll know. Nevertheless, the concert was the perfect end to my day and it ended all too soon at 10pm.\r\nA night by the sea\r\nI thought I might have trouble sleeping in a tent with no lock, but the sound of the sea served as a unique lullaby. I slept like a baby, lulled by the rhythmic roar of the waves and the flapping of the tent covers.\r\nAn excerpt from my Diu diary:\r\nThe setting sun\r\nAnd the receding tide\r\nLeave no doubt\r\nAbout the content of the birds’ chatter\r\nAnother day gone by\r\nAnother basketful of stories\r\nTo be told on a moonlit night.\r\nThe day might have been\r\nThe sun’s chirpy protege\r\nBut the night belongs\r\nTo the roaring sea\r\nAnd the scented breeze\r\nThe night belongs to your restlessness\r\nAs retold by the fervid shores.\r\nMorning magic\r\nWords would be quite insufficient to describe the magical metamorphosis I witnessed in the wee hours of the day. But I’ll try. I was awakened by the raucous sound of migratory birds and dragged myself out in my pyjamas to see the sky filled with formations of countless birds. They made their way across Diu in waves of perfect ‘T’ formations and I thought it would never end. But finally, it did. And the sun hadn’t even begun to rise yet. It’s amazing what goes on in this world in the hours between twilight and daybreak.\r\nAn excerpt from my Diu diary:\r\nHere I am, all alone outside my tent by the sea at the crack of dawn, watching the birds and wondering in my usual daft manner – which side is east and which is west. A few lone humans wander in the distance, not unlike the birds. The humans hunger for answers in the unfolding of a beautiful new day while the birds, simple creatures that they are, hunger for food. Me – all I want is a good shot and a few shells worth of Diu memories.\r\n \r\nOnce the sun began to make its way across the horizon, I discovered an all new delight – bird watching. Numerous land and sea birds scoured the sands and seas for their morning meal and I spent a wonderful time watching, chasing and photographing them. And then there was the sunrise itself – it made me want to stay another day in Diu and simply stare at its unblemished waters for hours. But I was only here till mid-day.\r\nAuto-rickshaw tour of Diu!\r\nSince I hadn’t been able to look around on my first day here, I was determined to travel the length and breadth of Diu on my second and last day here. After an early buffet breakfast of toast and omelette, fruits, idli chutney, beetroot juice (such a good cleanser!) and coffee, I set off for the main city circle, a 10 minute walk from Diu Village in search of an auto-rickshaw.\r\nI love this thing about small towns of India – the autowallahs always have a fixed route and rate for sightseeing and they’ll do it at express speed. I told them I had only three hours – would I be able to cover 600 rupees worth of sightseeing in that much time? They were more than confident. I tried my best to bargain but they wouldn’t budge. If you’re in a group of three, you can still fit in the large rickshaws and you would only pay Rs 200 per head.\r\nOver three hours, I explored the marvellous Naida Caves and sprawling Diu Fort, experienced the coolness of a spring at Gangeshwar Temple hewn into the ground, enjoyed a panoramic view of the island at INS Khukhri Memorial, conversed with a retired navy man at their unique seashell museum, admired the architecture of St Paul’s Church and Diu Museum, relaxed at the tranquil summer house and walked through the still under construction Fudam Bird Sanctuary and Dinosaur Park. \r\n'),
(82, 'Diu', 'https://www.tourmyindia.com/weekend-tours/images/ahmedabad-diu-weekend-tour2.webp', 'The Ultimate Guide to Diu Travel\r\nBy Vishal Ostwal\r\n“I grew curious about this place and wondered – how would I feel if I ever got there? So I did”\r\nI never travelled solo, until I decided to visit Diu. I did it to experience the exhilaration of travelling solo itself, and to somewhat break open my comfort zone. Sorry, but I’m not the ‘wanderlust’ type.\r\nIf you’re like me, you might have lots of questions even before you pack your bags.\r\nDiu\r\n• Is the place a fine travel destination?\r\n• How should I reach this solitary island?\r\n• Is it safe and cheap there?\r\n• How much would it cost me?\r\nI’m writing this post hoping to solve all your questions at once – so you can finally visualise and understand all that you’re curious about.\r\nWhom is Diu ideally for?\r\nBefore I even begin this post let me set certain expectations so you can decide whether Diu is the kind of place you dream about.\r\n• You’re introverted and wish to explore an uncrowded paradise.\r\n• You want a break from the chaos you’re stuck in.\r\n• You love spending time looking at water, doing nothing.\r\n• You’d like spending time at a single destination.\r\nIf the above criteria doesn’t suit you, then you might still want to visit Diu. The place itself is called the ‘isle of calm.’\r\nSo, where do we begin?\r\nAlright.\r\nNow let’s consider that you’ve decided to visit this place (use your imagination) – and you need to pack your bags.\r\nSo here’s a list of things you might want to take along with you, considering that you’d be closer to beach and travelling frequently.\r\n• IDs and their photocopies – This is a must, right? For hotels, train ticket verification, and all that stuff. You don’t want to spend time searching photocopy shops.\r\n• Slippers or sandals – This is ideal footwear if you’re packing light and don’t wish to bring along your whole wardrobe. Shorts for beach.\r\n• Mobile Waterproof Cover – To save your device from splashes, and having one less thing to worry about.\r\n• Cellphone Power Bank – It can help you a lot when you feel helpless on your journey, or spend too much juice clicking pictures.\r\n…and any other stuff that probably doesn’t need to be mentioned.\r\nFor instance, you might want to carry a tripod, sunscreen, or a teddy bear. I don’t know. Stuff your back with whatever you think you’ll definitely need later.\r\nSo you’re all set to step outside your home. But hey, how do you get there? Okay then, let’s sort it out.\r\nHow to reach Diu (the ideal way)\r\nDiu, the tiny island, has its own airport – so you can arrive here via air. Though, if you don’t find any direct flight till here, then you can reach Ahmedabad or Rajkot and then get a bus ticket from there.\r\nI departed from Aurangabad.\r\nSo I travelled in the Rameswaram-Okha express (a sleeper seat cost about ?480), reached Rajkot, and visited the local bus stand from where regular buses to Diu are available.\r\nFrom there, you’ll be directly taken to Diu via Somnath, and the ticket would cost about ?250 (local travel is cheap throughout Gujarat).\r\nThe buses to Diu are scarcely filled. By the time I reached Diu, there were only 6 people in the bus, including the driver, conductor, and a family of three.\r\nTips:\r\n• Use waiting rooms at railway stations.\r\n• Keep some food and snacks handy.\r\n• Gujarati Thaali for those on budget.\r\n• Got time to spare? Visit Watson Museum in Rajkot, or a place that’s near you.\r\nYou reached Diu, now what?\r\nThe Diu bus stand (Jethibai Bus Station) doesn’t have an infrastructure – so practically speaking, you can’t sit there and plan the next thing to do, charge your phone, or even rest for a while.\r\nChances are, all buses would drop you here at evening or at night, so it’s better if you book a hotel for yourself in advance. Almost all hotels are close to the bus stand anyway.\r\nWhen I reached Diu in December, it was raining (the aura felt fantastic!). The bus dropped me at about 8:30 P.M. I hadn’t booked a hotel as I didn’t have an exact plan.\r\nSo I simply stood at a corner, searched ‘hotels near me’ on maps, called one and bargained on the phone, and checked-in.\r\nTips:\r\n• Don’t panic if your travel doesn’t occur the way you had planned it.\r\n• Get a better hotel if you’re travelling with your family.\r\n• Bargaining offline can increase your chances of getting a discount.\r\nHey, so you’re in Diu already\r\nGo, get some sleep in your hotel and you can start your trip the next day. If you’ve reached early, then maybe take a walk and stroll around.\r\nBefore that, here’s a list of quick facts about Diu.\r\n• All tourist destinations are FREE here.\r\n• It depicts a mix of Portuguese and Gujarati culture.\r\n• Diu is the tenth least populated district of India.\r\nYour first day in Diu\r\nDiu is a small place, so it doesn’t take long to travel across the whole place. You can do it within a day. Or take another day, if you’re in no hurry.\r\nRent a bike. You’ll find several shops around Jethibai Bus Stand which offer bikes and mopeds for hire.\r\nThey charge about ?350 to ?300 for a day. About ?100 extra for fuel, if that tank isn’t full. You’re a free bird! Travel wherever you want, whenever you want.\r\nI rented a Hero Splendor (the hotel owner offered one to me) for ?300 and gave him additional ?50 rupees. They were kind to me.\r\nMost tourist spots in Diu are close to each other, except Nagoa beach, Gomatimata beach, and Vanakbara (fishing village), which are a bit farther. So it’s better to visit them at the last.\r\nNow, I\'m going to skip certain parts such as where you can eat, how much alcohol costs (I have no idea), which hotel you should hire (ask that Trivago man, maybe).\r\nYet, feel free to comment.\r\nHelp each other in the comments section, solve some general queries, and share your perspective.\r\nThere you go\r\nOld Diu Fort and Heritage Walk\r\nStart you journey from the Old Diu Fort, which is nothing but a fort-like structure that leads you to the Diu Heritage Walk.\r\nThe thing about Heritage Walk is that it passes through the residents of Diu, and extends up to Jalandhar beach. So if you keep walking on it, then you might explore a less seen side of Diu.\r\nThe entrance to the Heritage Walk is a small door, which is lost in the market. So ask any locals for directions.\r\nNaida Caves\r\nThis place is a fair combination of beauty and mystery. Once you’re between the caves, you’ll want to keep exploring the whole place, until you find its other end.\r\nI went alone at this place, didn’t find any other human, and there were no guards – so it was scary being there, undoubtedly. At the same time, I loved it.\r\nFort Diu\r\nFort Diu is located right beside the sea, and you can see the skyline from there. The waves hit against the fort, reaching till the top.\r\nI hoped to see Diu from the top of Lighthouse, but couldn\'t, as it was closed for public. But the view from fort was spectacular, too.\r\nOh, and quench your thirst with coconut water after you step out of Diu Fort. No hurry, take it easy.\r\nFudam Bird Sanctuary\r\nHave a DSLR? Take it with you.\r\nSeveral people might find this place boring, as there isn’t much happening. But there’s a thing about watching birds live in their natural environment, away from humans.\r\nSt. Paul\'s Church\r\nI couldn\'t stop thinking about what might have happened there about 400 years ago. I stood there, gazing at the sculptures, and noticing all the details.\r\nDiu Museum\r\nIt\'s used to be a church, but now it has been turned into a museum, and contains several statues and objects from the Portuguese era.\r\nINS Khukri Memorial\r\nAlthough the main attraction here is a model of INS Khukri Submarine, the place seems even better to be at.\r\nIt feels good to be at a place where the air is calm and you feel one with nature.\r\nChakratirth Beach\r\nIt\'s such a lovely place for picnic - simple, clean, and mesmerising. You can spend a whole day here.\r\nWhen you\'re in Diu, it feels like God emptied the whole place for you. I was mostly alone everywhere, as if everyone had gone to Mars already.\r\nJalandhar Beach\r\nThe waves are aggressive, and yet, the sea as a whole appears to be captivating. There are definitely a lot of places for you to sit and enjoy the view.\r\nCaution: Not all beaches in Diu are safe, so resist your urge of swimming. As far as I know, Nagoa Beach is the place to be at if you wish to swim or relish water sports.\r\nVanakbara Village\r\nAt Vanakbara, you\'d find fishermen doing their daily chores.\r\nThey\'d be busy storing ice in their boats, building new new ships, transporting fish and performing other activities. It seems as though Diu reflects all versatile sides of sea and coastal life at once.\r\nBut, this place stinks.\r\nOther sides of Diu\r\nI hope you\'ve got a clear picture about what your trip to Diu could look like. Yet, here are some more pictures to help you out.\r\nDiu has lots of trees. Hoka, coconuts, palm, and whatnot. All roads are either surrounded by trees, or the sea.\r\nHoka trees are only found in Diu in the whole country. If you want to know what a Hoka fruit tastes like, then you don\'t even need to buy it - Hoka trees are all around, so you pick one from the trees.\r\nNot kidding.\r\nDiu is a really safe and well-organised place. It even has a separate lane for bicycles, and the traffic is negligible. No heavy vehicles like trucks and buses.\r\nAlso, the place turned out to be better than my expectations. I had this misconception that Diu might be a rural and undeveloped place - but it surprised me!\r\nWhere after Diu?\r\nSo, now that you\'ve travelled Diu, where else would you like to go?\r\nIf you wish to head back to your home, then simply sit in an auto to reach Una for ?20, and get a bus to Ahmedabad or somewhere else from there.\r\nOr you can explore rest of Saurashtra and Gujarat. I choose to visit Somnath, Dwarka and Okha after Diu.\r\n'),
(83, 'Gulmarg', 'https://www.tourmyindia.com/states/jammu-kashmir/image/gulmarg-jummu-kashmir-baner.jpg', 'Gulmarg touched my soul, Srinagar enriched my senses\r\nbyMANJULIKA PRAMODDECEMBER 14, 2020 \r\n\r\nIt has been more than 24 hours that I have returned from Srinagar but I am still hung over the alphabet K. It stands for both Khyber and Kashmir. The memories of snow-splashed Gulmarg, the wholesome hospitality of ‘The Khyber Himalayan Resorts and Spa’, the striking beauty of the 46 varieties of tulips in Srinagar, the colourful life of Dal and Nigeen lake, the rich and aromatic taste of Kahwah, the heritage of Awantipora, history of Martand Sun temple of Mattan and the beauty of houseboats has left me asking for more. I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I said that I have lost a piece of my heart to one of the most beautiful valleys of the world. Kashmir is truly magical.\r\n \r\n \r\n“Gar firdaus, ruhe zamin ast, hamin asto, hamin asto, hamin ast”,\r\n “If there is ever a heaven on earth, its here”\r\nThe above lines were said by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.\r\n \r\n \r\nFor years, I have saved on the use of the word ‘heaven’ aka ‘jannat’ because I feared its frivolous use for a place that did not deserve it. The idea was to see Kashmir first and then take a call. I am glad I maintained the restraint. Many sobriquets and poems have been used to describe the beauty of Kashmir valley but there isn’t anything bigger and better than ‘paradise’. The urge to see and experience it with naked eyes was a deep hidden desire and now that it is fulfilled, I can only say that one has to see it to know what it is all about. I am not going to convince you to travel to this part of the northernmost state of India because you must understand that it is an experience of the soul and the senses, much beyond my words and jargons.\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat happened when I said I was travelling to KASHMIR?\r\n \r\n Last year, when I had travelled to Ladakh in September and Jammu in December, no one had said a word of caution but the moment I mentioned Kashmir, almost everyone in the family had a view about it. The concern around the safety issues and the breaking news from the valley got everyone talking. I knew they were not wrong at their place but my desire to see the valley was intense. I promised each of them that I would be vigilant. The apprehensions made me nervous too but the way my trip happened under the careful guidance of the locals, I have been asking myself, ‘Did I visit the same Kashmir that we often hear about in news and media?’\r\n \r\n \r\nThis seriously makes me question that why are we only talking negatively about a place that has a positive side too. I do not deny the fact that there are areas which are risk prone but this doesn’t mean that entire Kashmir is unsafe to travel. In fact, during my stay, I met some extremely wonderful Kashmiri people who strongly spoke about their passion. They talked about their house boats, the importance of revival of tourism, the steps that must be taken for the cleaning of Dal lake, the trails that must happen for exploring the hidden gems of architecture and the need to protect the Kashmiri culture. \r\nGulmarg is gorgeous while Srinagar is spell-binding!\r\n \r\n \r\nThey say Gulmarg is beautiful in all seasons but since I have not seen it in other months, I have to say that fresh sheet of snow in April made it powerfully and mysteriously attractive. To add to it, the idea of holidaying in Khyber resorts and spa made it an wholesome and complete experience in itself. I could easily spend the whole day looking at the Pir Panjal ranges while sipping glassfuls of Kahwa. But when I stepped out to explore, I did not want to return. From doing a short road trip to oldest shrine of Babareshi, to the idea of walking down to Rani temple and St. Mary’s church and finally taking the Gondola ride, the time spent in Gulmarg was absolutely fascinating. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nA shikara ride on Dal lake was the first thing that I wanted to do in Srinagar. I had nursed this dream forever and I am glad I lived it. The gardens of Srinagar are one of the best that I have seen all over the world. The Tulip festival is one of the best in Asia and no doubt it gives severe competition to the tulip garden of Holland. This city on the banks of Jhelum has many shades to it and I think I did see a bit of it when I walked around the boulevard road and bund (a pathway by the Jhelum) and peeked into its everyday life closely. The trip to Awantipura and Mattan via Anantnag were like adding a wealth of knowledge around the history and heritage of Kashmir. And no trip to Srinagar is complete without drinking the sweet water of Chasme Shahi and visiting the Shankaracharya temple and Hazrat bal mosque. \r\n \r\nEach day in Kashmir was like discovering a beautiful secret and peeping into its soul a little deeper. As far as my food experiences are concerned, every indulgence deserves a separate story. I must tell you that I have brought back walnut fudge from ‘Just Baked’ and I am loving it.\r\n \r\n7 days in Kashmir!\r\nDay 1 –    Delhi to Srinagar via Indigo. Road transfer to The Khyber Himalayan Resorts and Spa. \r\nDay 2 –   Explored the property as well as Gulmarg’s famous Shrine, Temple, Gurudwara and Church.\r\nDay 3-    The famous Gondola ride for the day and indulgence in spa at Khyber  in the evening!\r\nDay 4-    Traveled to Srinagar after a short hike to Drung.  Sunset at Dal lake made the day.\r\nDay 5-     Attended the Tulips festival (1st April to 15th April) and visited other famous gardens.\r\nDay 6-     A trip to Awantipora and Mattan in the day and  Hazratbal mosque in the night.\r\nDay 7-    A visit to Shankaracharya temple and a leisure ride on the Dal lake.\r\n               Flew back to Delhi via Vistara. \r\nTourism should be above all religion…\r\n\r\n Kashmir is still on my mind. I am glad that I have come back with a different picture of it which is quite different to what I knew about it through television and media. It is such a beautiful place that it needs to live and thrive. Instead of making it a paradise in conflict, we should do everything that it takes to revive its peace. The serenity of the place is magical. With no political inclination or influence, the last that I can say is that Kashmir is a paradise and nothing should stop us from visiting it for its beauty, its people and its tourism\r\nThe 3 days of my trip in Gulmarg was sponsored by The Khyber Himalayan Resorts and Spa.\r\nThe other 4 days in Srinagar were taken care by Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Department along with Kashmir Trails! \r\n'),
(84, 'Gulmarg', 'https://www.tourmyindia.com/states/jammu-kashmir/image/gulmarg-jummu-kashmir-baner.jpg', 'July 23rd 2012\r\nWell now, this is about trip to Gulmarg, the crown of Jammu & Kashmir as the locals call it. It is getting a little difficult for me to explain in words. What a picture perfect destination is it!! Just cannot stop praising about its beauty. I had been there just a few days back in the first week of July & understood one thing, If you love beauty then you have to be here to witness it. A delight to one\'s eyes. This is a famous destination for winter sports as it is completely covered with snow in winter, but if you want to see it green then July is the perfect time. Why I feel that July is the right time because rest of the time it is heavily crowded and all you get to see is lots of people and less of scenery.\r\n\r\nGulmarg is around 2 Hrs drive from Srinagar, the capital city of Jammu & Kashmir. The road becomes picturesque once you start moving up towards the mountains of Gulmarg. The main peak in Gulmarg is Affarwat which is 4143M. Once you reach there, you need to park your vehicle at the parking stand & either \r\nby walk or by hiring a pony do the sightseeing which are at a KMS walk. Gulmarg is also famous for its Gondola ride, which goes up to Affarwat Peak. The Gondola ride is 2 Kms from the Parking area which takes you to level 1 & level 2. We hired a local guide who got us our Gondola tickets and charged Rs. 500 over the Gondola tickets. Hiring a local guide is a good idea as the queue for tickets is too long and it is difficult for a tourist to get the tickets. Level 1 is the mid point of the gondola ride once you reach there the view is extremely scenic & Level 2 is the Affarwat peak the most famous amongst all.\r\n\r\nAs i had been there in the month of July, it was all green. We parked our vehicle at the parking area and after an hour long discussion with the Pony owner, finally decided to hire a pony. First the pony took us to the Gondola station, from there we boarded the Gondola & reached Level 1.We clicked some snaps of the beautiful scenery & of course of ourselves. The Pony was already  \r\nwaiting for us at the level 1 & we moved towards Khilanmarg - the point between Level 1 & 2. What I understood about this place is that if you love nature then only you should be here. However ,in winter season it attracts people who are adventurous and love winter sports. It is a very famous ski resort and has different sports activities like Ice Skiing , sledge rides, ice skating, ice flyers going up and down and much more. But, if you go in July its only nature at its best.\r\n\r\nOnce you reach Khilanmarg you can sight the Himalayan mountain strings, some covered by clouds and different shade of color in each one of the cloud (depending on weather condition). This place offers an outstanding view of the Himalayan ranges and the Kashmir valley. When we reached, we were all excited to see the glacier as the pony owner\'s said that we can sight some. The sledge ride guy\'s came up to us asking us to try, but we were not really interested as the glacier was not a huge one to try it. There were also some ski guys who claimed that they could teach  \r\nus skiing in 10mins,wonder how would that be possible. No matter in whichever month you visit this place, the climate is completely unpredictable & can change any time. The Gondola operates only if the weather is clear. If you wish to go to Affarwat peak then you need to buy a level 2 ticket. As i did not go there I do not have much Knowledge about it, but the locals said that oxygen level in the air is low and one should be fit enough to go there & a medical camp is also available at the Affarwat peak. One can also try having Kashmir Kawa a speciality drink in the chilling weather of Khilanmarg.\r\n\r\nAfter spending around 45 Mins in Khilanmarg, we headed back towards the gondola station at level 1 on our ponies & boarded the gondola to come down to Gulmarg valley. Again magic - magic our ponies were waiting for us to drop us back to the parking area. One thing I would like to add is that Gulmarg has a world\'s highest golf course. It is 18 holed & has a par of 72. If you wish to strike a ball here then \r\nyou need to contact the J&K Tourism board for information.\r\n\r\nGulmarg has very few hotels and there are some cottages as well but they are quiet expensive. If you do not wish to spend too much of money on stay in Gulmarg then a day excursion is advisable. Although I had been there in July still the weather was quiet cold. If you are not used to cold climate then its good to carry warm clothes. Once you reach there, vendors will run around saying that you will feel cold at Level 1 & Level 2 so you need warm clothes and ask you to take winter clothes on rent of Rs. 200. Just to share, I was convinced with the vendors offer and took clothes for a rent of Rs. 200. I wore it over the clothes which I was already wearing and after reaching level 1, the only thing which those clothes did for me was saved my clothes from getting dirty & not from the cold weather as it was not really that cold. Of course, if you go between Nov - APR then you definitely need those heavy woolen clothes.\r\n\r\nNow talking about the \r\narea , it has good facilities available like washrooms (pay and use), Parking, Pony stand (a little shabby and stinky & if it rains then its very bad), few food joints (small local shops), Shops for buying Kashmiri dress, shawls & other woolen stuff.\r\n\r\nSharing some other information , those who opt for a day excursion to Gulmarg from Srinagar usually leave by 4 / 5 Pm. so that they reach Srinagar during daylight. For those who stay overnights in Gulmarg they do not have to worry.\r\n\r\nSome more info:\r\n\r\nNearest Airport - Sri Nagar 65 Kms.\r\n\r\nClimate -\r\n\r\nWinter : November to February extremely cold. (- 5C to 10C)\r\n\r\nSummer : March to May pleasant weather (13 C to 29 C)\r\n\r\nMonsoon : July & August.\r\n\r\nAutumn : September and October.\r\n\r\nFood In J & K - Most of the restaurants are such with both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. If a non vegetarian, then you will not have any problems about food, But if a veggie & have problems in eating at a \" Veg Non-Veg\" restaurant then you might have a little tough time. Pure veg restaurants are \r\nvery rare. However in Gulmarg there are only few restaurants.\r\n'),

I truly believe that for me this is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in the world and today I am sharing some exciting moments from my trip to Gulmarg \r\nI don\'t think this one post is enough to really explain my entire experience but I will try my best to keep it short and as informative as I can.\r\n \r\nAbout Gulmarg:\r\n Gulmarg hill station is a popular skiing destination. The town is situated in the Pir Panjal Range in the western Himalayas. In the 17th Century when Mughal Emperor Jehangir visited Kashmir he said that “Gar firdaus bar-rue zamin ast, hami asto, hamin asto,hamin ast.” Meaning (“If there is a heaven on earth, it\'s here, it\'s here, it\'s here.”) and till date, this quote holds true for all the tourist who visit and get mesmerized by the beauty of this place. \r\nMystic Snowclad Mountains, scenic beauty, mesmerizing views is how I had seen Gulmarg in Bollywood movies and it was exactly what I saw even in reality. I always wanted to go there, experience and perform famous Romantic Shahrukh Khan style Bollywood songs in the snow, which eventually I did \r\n \r\nMy fears: \r\nFirst of all, I couldn\'t imagine myself in -14 degree temperature, I wasn\'t even sure I will be able to breathe in that kind of temperature\r\nThen I wasn\'t sure with all that snow around will we get any decent food to eat? \r\nWith so much negative news on unrest in this area, I wasn’t sure what the actual condition was and will we be safe there? \r\nThen I couldn\'t think of a good reason that why are we shifting our business meeting to Gulmarg? To experience adventure sports?\r\nTo make our business meeting fun and adventurous, we planned this trip and can you believe it, learning a sport was part of our KRA. \r\n \r\nHow to reach Gulmarg?\r\n So without much choice then I packed my bags - mentally, physically, emotionally prepared myself for this trip, went to the Mumbai airport, met my colleagues and got on that plane (Mumbai – Delhi). \r\nI have travelled before to Indian and International Locations but this place, so close to the border was a first time thrilling experience for me. This place does have very high security. I was really excited about the journey ahead.  \r\nTo reach Gulmarg you can catch a flight from Delhi airport which is the sole departure point for flights to Srinagar. It takes about 1 hr 45 mins to reach Srinagar from Delhi and if you have a window seat, you will love the view of the Himalayas. It’s always better to pre-plan and book your packages in offseason to get the best rates. The journey from Srinagar airport till the hill station Gulmarg Kashmir is 60 kilometers by fully paved road. This is a (2 to 3 hours’ drive). \r\nMy stay at Nedou’s Hotel: “Home away from Home”\r\nAfter crossing all the pine and fir forest and villages and after all that curiosity, excitement, and fear we finally reached our destination Nedou’s Hotel in Gulmarg \r\n \r\nThis hotel is a historic location and was launched in 1800’s by its founder Micheal Adam Nedou. The hotel has hosted numerous dignitaries, royalties, future world leaders from across the globe. They had renowned visitors, from Mahatama Gandhi, Prime Minister Nehru, Mountbatten etc… to name a few.\r\nWhen we visited the entire hotel was covered in this amazing white snow. The view from every corner of this hotel was just so magical. I had a big wide smile on my face when we reached the hotel. The temperature was freezing. We all were super excited, our inner child had suddenly woken up, we didn’t even bother about our luggage and just got out of the car, running in random direction speeding towards the snow, we instantly started playing, rolling and jumping in the snow.\r\nThe hotel staff was extremely sweet and helpful. We received such a great welcome and we were first taken in a warm main dining room space which was also the lobby area, we were given some warm water. The staff was too kind to take our jackets and place it near the Bukhari for us to dry up and get normal.\r\nFood, Ambiance, Services, Staff, Rooms, Amenities & Facilities, Entertainment, Activities etc... the Hotel was 5*/5 experience in all the checklist. Prices are high here but since we booked in offseason we got good rate packages. \r\nThings to do in Gulmarg:\r\nGulmarg is the heartland of winter sports in India and rated as Asia\'s seventh best ski destination. Over the years Gulmarg attracts a large number of tourist. It also has Asia’s largest and world’s second largest cable car project called Gulmarg Gondola where it connects Gulmarg with Apharwat Mountain, from where one can ski down on a long snow-trail. Gulmarg is also known for its longest Golf Course in India.\r\nThere are many places in Gulmarg for sightseeing and so many activities you can possibly do here like: Skiing (Visit Indian Institute of Skiing and Mountaineering), winter sports like skiing, tobogganing, snowboarding, and heli-skiing take place on the slopes of Mount Apharwat reachable by a Gondola lift. Trekking (April - November) There are so many limitless adventures in Gulmarg which begin from the three trekking trails- Alpather Lake, Khilanmarg and Apharwat. Gulmarg (60km from Srinagar), from which treks can be made to Apharwat and Alpather, the upland lakes of Vishansar and Gangabal and the Thajiwas Glacier. Gulmarg Gondola Cable Car Ride, Gulmarg Golf Course, Gulmarg Wildlife Sanctuary, Gulmarg View Point (Halt here - Srinagar to Gulmarg route), Srinagar Dal Lake  \r\nWe had so much fun playing in the snow and personally for me I even learned snowboarding, I did fell alot but there were instructors to teach me those little tips and techniques. Took me a few hours to actually even stand on that snowboard without any support. You can rent gears from local shops and get started.\r\n \r\nWeather & Best time to visit Gulmarg?\r\nThe weather is minimum – 8 degree Celsius approx from December till March. If you love adventure sports and wish to experience complete snowclad mountains then mid Jan to mid Feb is a recommended time to visit. Summer Season (April-June), Monsoon offSeason (July-September), Winter Season (October-March): Perfect for Skiing and adventure sports.\r\nFood in Gulmarg:\r\nThe local Kashmiri food is very delicious. They have the best bakeries. Kashmiri’s just love feeding you and they are so loving and caring. We tried the local Nadru Chips, Goshtaba, Kashmiri Dum Aloo, Wazwan, the famous Kashmiri Qahwah, Kashmiri pickle was also delicious, the sheermal roti was yum, we also had so many items for Morning breakfast, aloo tikki, mushrooms, waffle, eggs, variety of breads, local apple jam etc… their street Maggie is a hit, I loved eating Maggie here and had lots of soup in that crazy climate. We usually ate at Nedou\'s hotel and there were many street food stalls around the hotel where you can try the local food. Nadru chips you can try in Srinagar. You also get continental and international cuisine.  \r\n \r\nIs it safe to travel to Gulmarg\r\nYes, it’s very safe to travel here if you have a local contact or know a local good family. Usually, there is no threat to the tourist, but you can get caught up in an unpleasant situation. It’s best to know a local tour guide or a friend, there is a lot of security in the area. But it’s very important to be aware of your surroundings.\r\n'),

(89, 'Kohima', 'https://edge-cdn.pratidintime.com/2021/06/Kohima-1-859x540-1.jpg', 'This time we took a private taxi for our trip to Kohima because it’s much more pleasant than a bus and we wanted to treat ourselves a little bit. We stopped a few times along the way because there were various checkpoints where we had to register (again). We showed the passports and had to answer curious questions (why were we here? what our plans are?). It wasn’t easy for the police officers to understand that we just wanted to see the area and its people…\r\nThe heavy military presence continued throughout the entire way to Kohima. Every few hundred meters the road was flanked by really good looking Indian soldiers (sometimes on strategic little hills sitting behind walls made of sandbags). Everything seemed so serene; the road winded along upwards to Kohima but obviously there are tensions in the area. A movement for an independent Nagaland is silently active and occasionally some home-made bombs explode or some influential people are killed… For me as a traveller there didn’t seem to be any danger around, though the presence of the army told me differently.\r\nInformation tip:\r\nA good source for Nagaland information is the Nagaland Post.\r\nWe passed a bad accident along the way; a truck didn’t make it around a curve and said hello to a step divine (we assume he drove too fast). The area smelled badly of petrol, so we only took a quick look and then drove off before the thing was going to explode. Also it’s pineapple season in summer and along the road were lots of pineapple vendors and we’ve never tasted better pineapples than here. The fields of pineapples looked really beautiful planted along step hills. Some other food stalls sold fresh herbs & fruits like basil, oregano, tiny bananas and passion fruits. It’s a good in-between snack for this long drive.\r\nIt’s a 5-hour-drive up to Kohima and the temperature was getting a bit cooler. We were welcomed me with a heavy shower and another police checkpoint – “Passport number, visa number, where you come from, where you go to?” same old bla bla bla.\r\nAnyway, our hotel was a bit Spartan but well situated near the main road and the WWII cemetery. It was the Battle of Kohima where British and Indian soldiers fought alongside to stop the Japanese invasion in 1944. The war cemetery is the final resting ground for 1.400 brave soldiers who lost their young lives there. Today it’s a place where loving couples walk around or students sit in the sun and study. A quiet place in an otherwise bustling little city…\r\nKohima is a town perched on a few hills. It’s a bit stretched out and you can walk for hours. It’s an important trading point for all the small farmers who live in the area and as far as we noticed, everybody is really friendly. Our black headscarfs helped a lot though because we were not immediately picked out as foreigners.\r\nMarket Life.\r\nThe market was a heaven for strange food and lots of grubs, frogs, different insects and freshwater fish were on display. Of course, as I started to walk around I was curiously looked at by many people plus every policeman directing the traffic, so I bought a black scarf to wrap my blond hair into to be a little less recognizable as a foreigner.\r\nTravelling Around Kohima.\r\nThere are various bus and taxi stations, depending on the direction you wish to travel. We decided to continue to Imphal, the capital of Manipur. We decide on a shared taxi this time, to keep the costs down. It was a bit of a discussion with which car we should travel. We didn’t find out why, but we assume some taxi drivers knew, that with a foreigner in the car there will be delays along the way due to the checkpoints. One taxi driver was finally convinced when we told him that we’d buy three seats so we could take pictures on the right and left side when driving. The trip to Imphal passed through an impressive area, but this adventure will have to wait for another post.\r\n\r\nThe town of Kohima is located on the top of a high ridge and the town serpentines along the top of the mountain ranges as is typical of most Naga settlements.\r\n\r\nNagaland also known as the Switzerland of Asia is a breath-taking beautiful place. The people are very friendly and warm hearted. And Kohima is definitely a place well worth visiting!\r\n\r\nIn 1944 during World War II the Battle of Kohima along with the simultaneous Battle of Imphal was the turning point in the Burma Campaign. For the first time in South-East Asia the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies which they then retained until the end of the war. Kohima has a large cemetery for the Allied war dead maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Garrison Hill, in what was once the Deputy Commissioner’s tennis court which was the scene of intense fighting, the Battle of the Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nThese market women in Kohima really seemed to enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nThe market in Kohima was a real colourful experience.\r\n\r\nThe market in Kohima offers all sort of interesting things to look at.\r\n\r\nFrogs are just one of the strange things found at the markets in Kohima.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing in Kohima was the piping. Lots of water pipes border the streets, sometimes with outlandish connections; the same applies for electric wiring but that’s more common all over Asia.\r\n'),

Standing tall at an elevation of 1500 meters, Kohima was primarily highlighted on India Tourism map during the World War 2 for the decisive battle that was fought here between India, and Japan. Originally, it was known as Kewhira, when British Empire established their headquarters in 1878. It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963. Currently, it is a prominent hilly hamlet of Nagaland that can easily match the standards of all prime hill stations of NorthEast.\r\nOne can see the traces of Nagaland since 1840. The British tried to invade the Naga territory with a purpose to make an army camp Initially, the local Naga people were resistant as they were never overpowered by anyone, then after 40 years the British managed to capture its 10,000 square kilometers, leaving behind the Eastern region. In 1944, a war between England, and Japan was fought here, one can see the glimpses of all these events in its all travel places. Later in 1963, it was christened as the capital city of Nagaland.\r\nWhen it comes to the best places to see on the Nagaland tour, the first place that comes to our mind will be War Cemetery, the final resting ground of the soldiers who lost their lives in the England- Japan war. An inscription at the base of one the two large crosses here reads,\' When you go to home tell them of us and say, For your tomorrow, we gave our today.\' Overlooking the cemetery, there\'s Cathedral of Reconciliation; built in 1965, and partly funded by the Japanese government. Another fascinating tourism place in Kohima is State Museum. Located right in the north of the bazaar, the state museum exhibits the excellent anthropological collection of Naga mask, textiles, jewelry, and totem pillars from all the 16 Naga tribes.\r\nCatholic Church on Aradura Hill, which happens to be the largest wooden cross in the country; Kohima Zoo, home to Tragopan bird, and the state animal, the wild buffalo; Night market that sells souvenirs, street food and toys for children, and Deputy Commissioner’s Bungalow are worth an explore too over a holiday in Nagaland.\r\nDaredevils too have many reasons to visit Kohima. This top travel destination in India is close to Mt Japfu, the second highest peak in Nagaland, and Dzukou Valley, Nagaland’s valley of flowers. Travelers often stop at the base of these travel destinations to trek, and lay their eyes on the amazing varieties of lilies and rhododendrons, apart from several bird species.\r\nAs fascinating as the attractions are the colorful people of Nagaland. If interested in knowing the whereabouts of these tribes, two villages of Nagaland should be explored. One is Bara Basti, as settlement of Angami Naga tribe, located on the hill overlooking the town. Another one too is an Angami Naga village but a modernized one - Khonoma. The villages here known for their unique agriculture skills- growing 30 varieties of rice on terraced paddy fields.\r\nThe best time to go for a holiday in Kohima would be the winters, and monsoon as this is when one can see when the weather is good enough to go for sightseeing trips. Summers is just the perfect time to go for a trekking. Also due to its closeness to Dimapur, Kohima is easily approachable for tourist.

(92, 'Konark', 'https://img.veenaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Konark-Sun-Temple-History-Architecture-and-Information.jpeg', 'The Sun Temple at Konark is the pinnacle of Odisha Temple Architecture and an UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple is a culmination of seven hundred years of grind in search of perfection. Built in the 12th Century AD by King Narasimha Deva I and dedicated to the Sun God, the Sun Temple at Konark continues to leave us spellbound with its massive structure, symmetry, precision and intricate detailing.\r\nAccording to Archeologists the height of the Sun Temple at Konark is estimated to be around 227 feet, making it as one of the tallest temples ever built in the country. However what remains today is the impressive Jagamohana (Entrance Hall) with the sanctum sanctorum has but almost collapsed. The other structure that still stands amidst the ruins is the Natya Mandap minus the roof.\r\nThe temple was designed as a chariot of Sun God driven by twenty four beautifully carved wheels and pulled by seven horses. Apart from its beauty what captivates historians are the scientific precision. For eg- the wheels are designed in such a way that one can gauge the time of the day by looking at the shadow cast on the spoke of the wheels by the sun. Not only that the carvings of the spoke and axesls denote the activities that one normally does at that time of the day. The wheels popularly known as Konark Chakra is a popular souvenir collected by the tourists visiting the temple.\r\nThe temple was constructed using three types of stones – the laterite stone for the boundary walls, flooring and staircase, Khondalite for the structure and Chlorite stone for the door jams and lintel. The use of iron strips to hold the structure together can be seen amongst the ruins of the temple.\r\nSome experts are of the opinion that the Sun Temple was built in the sea, giving an impression of the Sun God emerging out of the water at day break. The European sailors referred to the temple as Black Pagoda because of the darkish impression of the roof of the temple. It served as an important landmark for the sailors navigating through the Bay of Bengal in those days.\r\nCelebrated poet Pt. Rabindranath Tagore uttered these famous words on seeing the magnificent Sun Temple at Konark – “Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man” – one couldn’t agree more, a visit to Konark leaves visitor’s with a lingering question at some corner of their mind “What If” !\r\nFestivals\r\nThe Konark dance Festival held from 1st Dec – 5th Dec is one of the prestigious classical dance festivals of the country. The open air theatre with the temple at the backdrop comes alive to the grooves of the maestro’s and transports the audience to the glory days of the Sun Temple.\r\nChandrabagha Mela – Held in the month of January every year, sees thousands of devotees taking a dip in the sea and praying to Sun God.\r\nSee to Believe\r\nBelow is a visual treat of Konark.

(93, 'Konark', 'https://img.veenaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Konark-Sun-Temple-History-Architecture-and-Information.jpeg', 'Visiting Odisha: Here comes the sun\r\nby Mariellen Ward · December 9, 2012\r\nSunny skies, sun-baked beaches and the Sun Temple\r\nThe sun is a constant motif in Odisha, a laid-back, sun-drenched state that runs along the coast of eastern India, well off the tourist trail. From the golden beaches of Odisha (formerly Orissa) you can watch both the sunrise and the sunset. At Konark, the UNESCO World Heritage Sun Temple was built to catch the rays of sunrise and light up a figure of Surya, the sun god. Odisha Tourism’s symbol is a colourful and childlike drawing of the sun.\r\nI came to Odisha (my 15th Indian state) for the annual Konark Festival — a celebration of Indian classical dance. Odisha is the home state of Odissi dancing, my favourite form of Indian dance; and the Konark Festival is a showcase for Odissi — as well as a showcase for the state.\r\nI long wanted to experience the Konark Festival and I was not disappointed. The venue is a beautiful open-air auditorium with the spot-lit pagoda of the Sun Temple as the dramatic backdrop. Colourful lights and lanterns filled the trees and lined the pathways, and the entire place was a fairy-tale like spectacle, beautifully decorated and the technical aspects of the festival were, overall, very well executed too.\r\nFollow my South Asia Sojourn from October 2012 to May 2013 — a six-month blogging trip through India, followed by a search for my family roots in Ireland. Subscribe to Breathedreamgo in the “Get updates by email” box to the right. Join the Breathedreamgo Facebook page; and the Breathedreamgo Twitter stream (hashtag #BDGIndia).\r\nThis year, the festival ran for five nights, from December 1st to 5th, and I attended the first three nights. All the dancing I witnessed was excellent, but I was particularly entranced on the second night, when I suddenly felt swept up in an Incredible!India moment.\r\nThe Odissi dancers moved together in perfect rhythm on the stage, bathed in multicoloured lights and accompanied by live musicians and singers. The music stirred and soared and the dancers reverently, passionately poured their energy into their devotion. Behind them, the 12th century Konark Sun Temple was lit up against the night sky, and overhead colourful lanterns filled the trees encircling the outdoor auditorium. I reclined on a padded settee, like a maharani of old, and allowed the warm tropical night air, the Indian classical sights and sounds and the magnificence of the setting to completely envelope me. I was living the Incredible!India ad campaign, and even I could barely believe it.\r\n \r\nWith all my amazing Indian experiences over the past seven years — meditating at sunrise on the Ganga, seeing the morning sun glint off the Taj Mahal, sleeping on the sand dunes of Jaisalmer — seeing Meera Das and the Gunjan Dance Academy of Cuttack perform at the Konark Dance Festival still gave me an unexpected magic moment. This renowned dance festival honestly surpassed all my expectations.\r\nAnd I owe it all to the gracious and generous Mohanty family and their company Swosti Travels. Mr and Mrs Mohanty came to Canada last year to present their home state, Odisha, to a room full of travel agents and writers. The dinner was co-presented with India Tourism — and together, they did a very good job of enticing me to a less touristy corner of India. Odisha, which is situated on the eastern coast of Indian, between Kolkata and Chennai, is known for beautiful beaches, ancient temples and a relaxed pace of life. The pride of Odisha is the Konark Sun Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of India’s truly great temples.\r\nThe new Kerala?\r\nOdisha reminds me a little of Kerala, but it has its own unique flavour. It has a warm, dry climate and because there are so few tourists, it has a laid-back, pastoral atmosphere. People are friendly and not at all aggressive.\r\nAfter seeing the pagoda of the Konark Sun Temple lit up as a backdrop to the Konark Dance Festival for two nights, I visited it for the first time at dusk on my third day in Konark. The 13th century Sun Temple is actually quite dark in colour — it’s known as the “Black Pagoda” — and surrounded by lush jungle. Apparently at one time it was near the beach, but now the sea is about three kilometres away. The entire, massive structure is a representation of the chariot of the sun god, Surya. Standing back, from the side, you can see the huge wheels.\r\nAside from the impressive size and shape, the Sun Temple is famous for the intricate carvings that cover its surface — an astounding number and variety. You can see people performing mundane household chores as well as, ahem, less mundane sexual acrobatics. I will be writing an entire blog about this temple and the commentary of my guide Krishna, who waxed knowledgeably and poetically as he showed me around and explained the mathematical and astronomical as well as mythological significance.\r\nKonark is actually a small town and there is very little to be seen in this area aside from the temple, the festival and the long, wide sand beach. But the festival includes an International Sand Art Festival and other displays such as a hand-loom exhibit. Many of the international sand carvers and die-hard dance fans stayed at the same place as me: The Lotus Eco Resort. I picked it because: one, the Lonely Planet recommended it; and two, it’s the only game in town.\r\nThough we got off to a bit of a rocky start (there were some lags in service), I slowly fell in love with the Lotus Eco Resort — in spite of its lack-lustre management and slightly ramshackle appearance. It occupies a lovely, remote spot, visited only by a few fishermen each day (who each give a portion of their catch to the resort restaurant: I ate fresh caught fish each day!). The Canadian pine cabins are small, but perfect. They are in very good condition and have every amenity you need. The grounds are nice, but not as well kept as possible; and the restaurant is a bit run-down. Some plain tables and plastic chairs are plopped down in the sand, near the beach, outside the restaurant, and this is where I usually ate.\r\nAfter a few false starts trying to get good, fresh food from the kitchen, one of the many wonderful resort guests I met, a man from Kolkata, introduced me to the chef Sunil — a warm man who is a very dedicated and talented cook. So once I started ordering directly from Sunil, I ate very well indeed. Crisp dosas for breakfast and fresh fish for dinner, bathed in the distinctive mustard-flavour seasonings that characterize Odiya cuisine.\r\nI also rearranged my room slightly to put a small desk under the window from where I had a view of the ocean, The Bay of Bengal, and the wide sandbar the runs along this portion of Ramchandi Beach. So here I sit writing this, as happy as I could be. Once again I have managed to find myself a perfect spot in India — perfect for inspiration and relaxation, writing and photography — with sun and sand, good food as well as a rich cultural experience.\r\nA precious adventure\r\nStaying at the Lotus Eco Resort also gave me the opportunity for the kind of small adventure that I love. I walked out on the deserted beach one morning about 7:30 a.m., it was already warm and sunny, and a boatman was there. I gave him 600 rupees (about $11 or $12) and he took me on a motor boat road along the coast, past gorgeous, empty beaches on one side and a long, wide sandbar on the other. In the distance I spied a mandir (Hindu temple), with the red flag flying, and I asked him to stop at the jetty.\r\nI got out and walked up to the mandir and a small town square. The whole scene was peaceful, pastoral and completely off the tourist track. I bought a coconut for 10 rupees and sat and drank the milk; and then the man who sold it to me whacked it open so I could eat the fruit. A couple of young men stared at me, but I felt safe, accepted and left alone. After that, the boatman took me over to the sandbar and I walked on the ocean side for some time — and I was the only person, as far as I could see in each direction.\r\nI had no camera, no guide, no one knew I was there and I felt completely free. For some reason, I felt like Sabu in the “Thief of Baghdad,” and I strolled down the beach singing, “I long to be a sailor sailing on the sea.” I felt like I had been deposited there, in this sunny place, with the surf pounding on the shore, as if by magic carpet.\r\nI love a place that can give me this kind of adventure. Thanks Odisha!\r\n \r\nInternational Sand Art Festival, Konark, Odisha\r\nPolishing a travel gem\r\nI’ll be writing more about my adventures in Odisha and getting to know the place, and the distinctive culture, but after a week or so here, my impression is that the state has a lot to offer. In December, the climate is perfect: warm and sunny in the daytime, and a bit cool in the evening. I am sure it is perfect all winter.\r\nThere are lovely beaches, ancient temples, a rich culture of music and dance and distinctive, delicious cuisines that features really fresh fish, herbs, vegetables and fruits. And perhaps best of all, the state has a relaxed vibe and a slower pace of life.\r\nHowever, aside from the big cities, there are very few places to stay. Only one “eco resort” in the country, for example. And though there are some fascinating and thriving wild life sanctuaries, they are hard to get to as they are a long way from Bhubaneshwar, the capital, and there’s no where to stay when you get there. Also, as friendly as the staff are in most places, they don’t really seem to know how to do their jobs. At one place, I asked the waitress to clear the table so I could sit down and eat, and she only wiped off one section, leaving crumbs and spills all over the rest of the table — and that is typical. She just didn’t know better.\r\nWith a bigger commitment to tourism, more infrastructure and better hospitality training, I am sure Odisha could become a much more popular tourist destination for Indians and foreigners. It is the proverbial diamond in the rough; and unpolished gem.\r\nThank you Swosti Travels and Odisha Tourism for hosting me.\r\n');

(94, 'Konark', 'https://img.veenaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Konark-Sun-Temple-History-Architecture-and-Information.jpeg', 'My First Road Trip To Konark and Puri Temple [ Complete Experience]\r\nBy Samudrika Pattanaik|June 17th, 2019|Odisha \r\nKonark Sun Temple – India is a country with many exquisite temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, Vishnu, Durga and many more. Did you know that our country also has temples dedicated to Sun? We have more than 12 sun temples in our country, amongst which the Konark temple and Sun temple at Modhera are the most remarkable ones.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThe Konark sun temple is a world heritage site, settled close to the smart city of Bhubaneswar. The ancient masterpiece was built in 1250 AD and is designed as a gigantic chariot. Further, it is designed as the chariot which is being pulled by 7 horses.\r\nThe sun temple depicts an impressive architectural style of Odisha and amongst the most visited places of the state. Precisely for this very reason, I shortlisted this tourist attraction for my husband’s first trip to Bhubaneswar.\r\n\r\nKONARK TRIP RIGHT AFTER MY WEDDING?\r\nIt was the year 2013, when both our parents (mine and my in-laws) gave approval to our relationship. Like every Indian bride, even I had specific dreams regarding my wedding. From selecting a stunning wedding lehenga to set up a welcoming Mehandi night; Each detailing felt so important, that I nearly forgot the pain of departing from my favorite city of Delhi. (As my husband was working in a different city, I had to relocate with him)\r\nBut sometimes bad news comes handy with some happy moments. Just before the week of my wedding, my father fell on the floor during one of his physio session. He had survived from a brain stroke a few years ago that made him one side paralyzed. With a heavy heart, both my parents had to cancel their tickets, which meant a wedding without my parent’s presence.\r\n& THE SAD NEWS\r\nI was devastated, but they didn’t want to call off or postpone the wedding. So we executed the main event in the presence of my siblings and all my close relatives. Without my parents, my D day felt no more special. However, I was marrying the man who stole my heart and ruining his special day would not have been fair. Anyways, to seek the blessings of my parents, we decided to visit them in Bhubaneswar.\r\nLike most of the Hindu families, even we believe in visiting a famous temple on every auspicious occasion. Similarly, in Odisha also we prefer to visit the world-renowned Jagganath Puri temple. Now, A Puri visit excluding the highly popular Konark temple looked so incomplete that we didn’t give a second thought to plan a trip.\r\n& THE PLANNING PART\r\nTo add some extra fun and obviously to boast about the incredible places of Bhubaneswar; I decided to add 3 main tourist destination (Konark , Puri and Dhauligiri) in our travel itinerary. I wished to add a few additional tourist destinations too, but we were on a time crunch. We could only sneak out 2 days for our Bhubaneswar tour that reserved the second day for Dhauligiri.\r\nWHY COULDN’T WE PLAN A WEDDING AT BHUBANESWAR?\r\nYou may wonder why didn’t we schedule the wedding in Bhubaneswar instead of Delhi? Well! As I mentioned earlier, mine is a love marriage, and like most of the Indian parents, even our parents had their views on why this relationship won’t last long.\r\nAfter our Shirdi visit, me and my two friends went to an awesome place called SULA VINEYARD. I met my guy accidentally here, where (Nashik) he was doing some official course. This might sound crazy but we chatted the entire night, (2 friends of mine and 3 friends of his) and I had to postpone my Mumbai trip for the next day.\r\nIt felt like the universe wanted us to meet. We almost missed catching the train and somehow hopped inside the running train with all our luggage. I don’t know if I was trying to act like Kareena Kapoor of Jab We Met that time? After our Shirdi darshan, I hesitantly went to the vineyard but destiny had some better plans for me. We didn’t even wait for a year to spill the beans and did expect many heated arguments for days.\r\nHe belongs to UP and me from the eastern part of the country. It triggered a plethora of questions like different cultures, status, caste, eating habits and my god the list is long. But there is a saying in Hindi, “Jab miya biwi razi toh kya karega kaazi.” His parents got convinced (his sisters, uncles and aunts played a huge role) and finally, the wedding date was fixed.\r\nSince my father was bedridden so I couldn’t get the courage to plan a wedding in Bhubaneswar (as I was not aware of that place so well). Instead chose Delhi where I stayed and worked for 7-8 years.\r\nROAD TRIP TO THE KONARK SUN TEMPLE\r\nWe decided to push off early in the morning around 8 am and began our first road trip together. We booked us a nice comfortable private taxi that took us to the mesmeric sun temple.\r\nIt took nearly 1 hour and 30 minutes and by 9:30 we were already wandering inside the premises of the black pagoda. The roads were pretty decent, that made our journey quite comfortable. Unlike me, my husband loves to explore the ancient architectural marvels of our country. He is a travel enthusiast and any place that has stories to tell, make my husband to fall dotty with it.\r\nLet me be honest here; I genuinely had a little apprehension about this historical masterpiece. What if, it doesn’t appeal to him? What if, he finds the place not so attractive?\r\nAs I visited this place long back in my school days, so didn’t have any memories. Other than what I read in my school books, I didn’t have any slightest idea about this glorious creation. So, this trip was equally important to me. You can also check our article on a complete guide of Konark Temple to get some more insights on its significance and history.\r\nFELL IN LOVE WITH THE ARCHITECTURAL STYLE\r\nThe exquisite carvings done on the chariots and the erotic sex symbols embedded on the walls of the temple were the highlights. Depicting the ancient Kalinga (now Odisha) architecture, the Konark sun temple is a photographers delight. The tourist love this place for its originality and its beautiful sculptures and carvings. Although most of the part of the temple has turned into ruins, it is still a top-rated tourist destination in Odisha.\r\nThe Konark temple is dedicated to the Sun God, however no deities are placed inside the building. On the other hand, the marvellous edifice takes you to the world of art and creativity. The historical monument screams a lot of stories that are hidden in its womb.\r\nDISAPPOINTED WITH THE COMMERCIALISATION\r\nAfter the sightseeing of Konark, our eyes glued on a Navagrah (nine planets) temple very close to the sun temple. Since prayers and lighting of diyas are not allowed in the Konark temple, most of the devotees offer their prayers in this temple. Just before you wonder the need of visiting any temple in your holiday, let me introduce you to Odisha. Odisha folks are super religious and thus have turned Bhubaneswar into a city of temples.\r\nIt was a small temple, and hence the less number of devotees were also looking like a crowd. After a quiet prayer, while exiting from the main door, a temple priest demanded donation money. Either he thought we do not belong to that part of the state or found us an easy catch. It was a shock for both of us the way he pestered us to give some amount of donation.\r\nI nowhere want to criticize the priests over here and simply sharing our personal experience. My husband got really disturbed by the money minting idea in the name of God. To lighten his mood, we picked a few gifts from the stalls available outside the temple and went to a nearby restaurant to grab some mid time snacks.\r\nENTRY TICKETS AND TIMINGS\r\nThe sun temple is open on all days from 6 am to 8 pm and costs 40 Rs per Indian traveller. For international visitors, the ticket costs around 600 Rs. There are separate tickets for the one hour light and sound show. It takes place in the evening around 7 pm and costs Rs 30. Headsets are given to the visitors to listen to the story in their preferred language of English, Hindi, or Odia.\r\nNEXT CHANDRABAGHA BEACH\r\nAfter capturing the aesthetic beauty of Konark, we headed towards the beach that stole our heart by its tranquillity. One of the cleanest beaches of Odisha, Chandrabagha beach is an ideal place to surrender to mother nature. The beach is located at a distance of 2 km from Konark temple and falls on route of Puri.\r\nThe pristine beach is not that commercialized so one could get ample privacy and enough house to stroll. By now, I could see the immense joy in his eyes and to be honest that made me so happy. However, we highly regret of leaving before the sunset, which would have given us some spectacular views. Just a word of caution that the beach usually throws strong and high waves which, makes swimming little risky.\r\nBefore bidding goodbye to this gorgeous beach, we quenched our thirst with the coconut water sold at the nearest shop. The roads looked smooth and well-maintained, but we were still dreaming about the incredibly serene beach. Gazing at the sneak peek of the beach and lush green forest, we enjoyed the rest of our road journey.\r\nANNUAL KONARK FESTIVAL\r\nA quiet beach on regular days, witnesses a massive flow of tourists during the international sand art festival. The festival happens every year in December. Various sand artists across the world, showcase their art on the sandy beach, which allures the art lovers the most.\r\nAdditionally, the beach has also gained his popularity due to its annual Konark festival that happens in December. It gives a platform to many established dance artists to perform different forms of dance forms, including Odishi, Kathak, etc.\r\n\r\nJOIN OUR FACEBOOK COMMUNITY\r\nHey, loved our story & experience? Then I have some good news for you. Join our Facebook growing community and be part of many such traveling stories. \r\nCONTINUED OUR ROAD JOURNEY TO PURI\r\nAfter an hour’s drive and covering a distance of 35 km (approx), we reached the most visited place of Odisha. Puri is one of the oldest city of the state and is also considered as the holiest town. As it was the first trip after our marriage, we went to meet my aunt’s (mom’s sister) family before heading for the Jagganath Puri temple.\r\nAfter enjoying a quick lunch, we stepped forward for the main temple. We were accompanied by a panda, (brahmins working inside the temple) who happened to be my uncle’s friend.\r\nOUR FIRST CHAAR DHAAM DARSHAN\r\nThe Puri Panda showed us the mega kitchen, where the scrumptious meal is cooked every day for the Lord Jagganath. The meal consists of 108 dishes and is prepared in the Earthern pots. He also explained to us the importance of various corners and deities of the temple.\r\nThe Jagganath Puri temple is one amongst the chaar dhaam teerth (four pilgrimage sites) and is located at Puri. The temple is home to many Indian Gods and Goddesses; primarily the abode of Lord Jagganath and his siblings. The temple has many mysterious stories, that you could find in one of our previous article on Jagganath Puri – A complete guide.\r\nAfter an enchanting darshan, it was the time to dive into another popular destination of Puri, which was the Puri beach. We had lunch at our aunt’s place; however, there are many hotels and restaurants near the Puri beach as well as the temple. In case you wish to eat nonveg during your trip then do check out the beachside hotels.\r\nWENT WILD IN PURI BEACH\r\nSince morning we were embracing the serenity, but this was the time to go wild and loosen up. After the stressful wedding preparations, the beach just felt right to get indulged in the fun activities. Unlike Chandrabagha beach, Puri beach was crammed with thousands of tourists coming from all over the country.\r\nI made him try all the street foods of our state and he liked a few of them. (He is a fussy eater anyway, so let me not blame my street foods) We didn’t try the elephant rides but we had so much fun there.\r\nSHOPPING EXPERIENCE AT PIPLI\r\nWe ended our trip by picking up a few souvenirs for our families and boarded our cab after the sunset. Coming to Puri and not stopping at the Pipli village is so disappointing. The place is popular for selling handicrafts and various handwork materials that are worth to add in your home décor. Keeping the tradition of shopping alive, I too grabbed a few things to add in my new home.\r\nWhile coming back from Pipli, our car suddenly stopped. The unexpected halt at the midway switched on my panic button. Thankfully, my uncle arranged another car that took almost 30-40 minutes, but eventually, we reached our home safe. The day started with a bang, unfortunately, had to witness a terrible end.\r\nHOW TO REACH\r\nThe capital city of Odisha has a well-connected airport as well as a railway station for the travelers. After reaching Bhubaneswar, tourists can either hire a private taxi for a round trip or can use a bus. In case of buses, one has to reach the Baramunda bus station to get the buses for Puri and Konark.\r\nBEST TIME TO TRAVEL\r\nDue to the hot and humid climate, the summers in Bhubaneswar is not very suitable for traveling. The ideal time to visit these wonderful places would be between August to early March.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRoad trips always add an extra oomph to our travel stories and make them more exclusive. Even though, we get to experience a few mishaps sometimes; it usually makes the travel journey enjoyable. From the crowded urban city to a stretch of forests and beaches is what you get from this road trip. Do try to explore every bit of it and make your vacation worthwhile.\r\n'),

To say that the mountains cast spells on me would be an understatement. I undertook few short treks around Bangalore and that was it, I am slightly a fanatic now! Kunti-Betta, Kabbaldurga, Bheemeshwari treks were some easy getaways from Bangalore and well, enough to quench my trekking thirst. Do you see the edge of that mountain? That was our destination point!\r\nThe trek was organized by a travel and adventure based company from Bangalore and they did not disappoint. As anybody else, I did my homework about the place and the picture came out heavenly. But it was much more scenic and pure in real. We started around 9:30 PM, a day before the Christmas eve. A group of over 30 people all set to embrace the adventure that was coming. The road to Kalasa from Bangalore gets beautiful once you enter the ghats, the night was pretty tiring and I am not an early morning person but something caught my eyes and the view still remains fresh. A faded orange shone brightly across the surface of the moon as it peeped through the trees to check the one\'s who disturbed the night\'s silent monotony. The mountains stretched wide holding with itself a magical charm. This ride was sort of a ride to home. I always had this feeling that a part me of belongs here. The zigzag roads could give anyone nausea but the scenery next to it took the sleep right out of my eyes and placed awe instead. We passed through the tea estates, the aroma was in the air, but the magic had just begun.\r\nWe reached Kalasa at around 7:30 AM. We needed to head to Mullodi village, the base point of the trek. Unfortunately, the rugged terrains to Mullodi are too rough for cars. Enters, Jeep! Those robust machines will do the job. Ours were arranged by the Homestay we booked at Mullodi. After about 30 mins of a bumpy ride, where you get to see the vast forest, the mountains, the mini water streams by the side, houses with kids waving hands at you(who, by the way, were adorable), we finally made it to the Homestay. Our bums hurting pretty bad and stomach growling with hunger. The homestay was pretty packed since it was a long weekend, we quickly freshened up, had a few idlis and left for the trek with packed lunch. We started in a very happy note, the scenery captivating us to take more selfies and pictures, and the trek lead reminding us to keep the pace. Since this was around 24 km trek (round trip), we had to maintain time to reach base by sunset, else the forest department will get pretty mad, and you don\'t want to experience that. To do this you need to start early, it would take around 8 hours (round trip) to finish the trek. So, try and descend from the peak by 2 PM, else you might end up with an experience like mine (read on to know more about it)!\r\nThe landscape was getting hold of me, all I needed was to take a seat and watch the mists take off, feel the cool wind against my skin and hear the musical notes of the stream but instead, I walked to see what the fuss was all about this trek. I heard the little birds say that this is one of the most beautiful treks of South India and they were nothing but right! I expected it to be a tiring one, but that again will be an understatement and a strict NO-NO for the first timers. We walked and walked, I was grabbing every opportunity to capture the scenery around me, but I think the beauty is too shy to be caught in a camera, you have got to experience it.\r\nThe rugged trail looks like the picture above, which gets narrower and steeper as you move ahead. I walked past few river streams, the only drinking source to keep you hydrated as the sun is quite determined to squeeze the hell out of you. The crystal clear water tasted surprisingly good, I was a bit hesitant at first but now that I am still healthy and running, you have got nothing to worry about! Then we walked right into the forest and I was in relief to finally get some shade. But the view around was too enchanting to neglect, the trees served as an umbrella with little holes that brightened up our way. And then we walked and walked and then walked some more, the sun right above our heads, roasting our exterior and the breeze cooling it at the same time and definitely bringing in a sense of relaxation. We finally reached a point where everyone was resting and I thought we have reached, but nope!\r\nOur lead gave an evil grin and said, \"We have another 8 km to go, we just finished 5\". And my heart jumped to my mouth! I didn\'t want to rest, although my body was giving up already. I just knew I had to summit the peak by any means, but the moment I started walking, something hurt bad and apparently it was a muscle cramp. I squeaked as I tried to lift my right leg and the shit just got real. The scenery had started to unveil itself and it looked drop dead gorgeous.\r\nThe scenes around triggered my courageous bone every time I thought of giving up and that kept me going. That and some wonderful companions I befriended along the trip. Few had some questionable and inexplicable stamina, we nicknamed them as \"Mountain Goats\"; all that time at the gym did pay well! So, this friend of mine sadly had to say goodbye to her shoe\'s outsole, that was drastic since we had a ton of moving to do.\r\nAnd there she is holding onto the lunch; precious lunch as you are definitely not getting any tea or maggie up there to boost up your stamina. My body was functioning on its own, if it were for my body I would have given up a long time ago. I sat to drink up some water and my phone rang. No network at the base and here my rings. Astonished, I checked to see my mom calling and the conversation went something like this:\r\nMe: \"Hello\"\r\nMaa: \"Where the hell have you been? Your phone is not reachable since last night. Did you have any food?\"\r\nMe: \"I am climbing a mountain maa! And apparently I missing you and I am fine by the way (trying to hide my overwhelming emotions that started flooding out of the blue)\".\r\nAfter that inexplicable emotional outpour, I began my journey just to see that I still had a long way to go. The path got a bit crowded, and I clearly remember someone playing and singing to the lyrics of \"BABY, by Justin Bieber\". Weird things happen!\r\nThese hills, play with your brains. You look up and say, \"Oh! that\'s it. Few more steps and I can finally rest\". You give everything you got and reach the top to find a series of them just lying there, looking all pretty, but you can feel it in your bones that they are grinning and saying, \"Gotcha!\". I could wait no more, so I sat and had my lunch as I kept my eyes on the peak. The gang was very supportive, I might have had a different without them. We took a deep breath and started back with the trail. Many were coming back after summiting, then there were these bunch of kids, that my brain couldn\'t register were actually climbing this thing. The adults of their team boosted the little fellas to finish the trek and I couldn\'t agree more. The view was just right. You know that feeling when something feels just right, not less not more, but in correct proportion? Yes, this is perfection!\r\nI deserved a fine nap up there and so I said to myself, \"I wanna take a nap, I take a nap right here, Goodnight!\" It was pretty short as our lead suggested we start heading back right away since we have lost a lot of time climbing. So late that we descended at around 4 PM, which is very, very late. The trail felt much longer while returning, we had a few hours of light left and our energy was just hanging by a thread. \r\nYou can see the trail in the above picture and it\'s only 20 percent of it. My feet hurt like it was to fall off but I still had to walk and I kept reciting, \"Food is at the base\" and trudged meekly. The never ending trail tested not just my physical strength but also my mental stability; I passed with flying colors. The real excitement began when the Sun went to light up the other side of the world. Torches/Phones were dearer than anything at that moment. The place is definitely pretty for the eyes but your feets will curse you! !@#$%\r\nI knew we were late but we figured soon that we were actually very late. It was around 7, pitch dark! thankfully a local guide walked with us, the trail was pretty confusing inside the forest. I was holding my backpack and a camera bag, struggling to keep them in place as my shoulders were in terrible pain, the gentleman asked if I needed help with the bag, which I did. And I can\'t really thank him for the gesture. Time was running slow and we were nowhere near the base and suddenly a bunch of locals came in and asked us to move quick. The forest department were quite pissed that we were so very late; can\'t really blame them. I helped and boosted my friends and stayed at the back to make sure no one was left behind and next to me was the guide. We did converse without knowing each other\'s language, it was rather funny as I was gesturing at him in dark and spoke words that made no sense. And then finally, we reached base. The clock said 8:30 PM, and I was already looking for a place to lie down. My body pained beyond explanation. Ended our day with some hot dinner and my sleeping bag couldn\'t be more comfortable. We bid farewell the next day \r\n\r\nShy and too quick for the camera, the owner\'s kids are \'adorablicious\'! We also had the chance to sleep in nature\'s lap, literally!\r\n\r\nWell, I had some pretty great weekend. Did you? I insist you go have one!\r\n“Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.”\r\n\r\n'),
(96, 'Kudremukh', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Kudremukh_TheHorseFace.JPG/272px-Kudremukh_TheHorseFace.JPG', 'Being an avid traveler and staying in Gurgaon for 3 years, I explored nearby states of Himachal and Uttaranchal very well. Well to the point that I have been to every Himachal district at least once. I have proudly done quite a few Himalayan treks. But while I was in Gurgaon, I used to feel this strong urge to explore the Deccan plateau. Though nothing can describe my love for the Himalayas, I still wanted to experience other parts of my country. So the moment I got a job opportunity in Bangalore, I said yes almost immediately.\r\nAnd after 2 months of that phone call here I was in Bangalore. The city offers so many beautiful places to explore within a 250 - 500 km radius. Since I came here I heard a lot about the popular trek, Kudremukh. But to my disappointment, the best time to do this trek is Monsoon or winter. I waited patiently and finally booked my trek in June.\r\nKudremukh is a national park and a habitat for various wild animals like lion-tailed Macaque, Hanuman Langur, and Malabar Slander Loris. Unfortunately, the Karnataka forest department does not allow trekkers to camp inside the national park. \r\nKudremukh national park is in the beautiful Chikkamagaluru district of Karnataka. The Kudremukh mountain peak is 1894m high. Kudremukh is considered most scenic trek in South India and is third highest peak in the state of Karnataka. Kudremukh in Kannada means horse mouth as the peak resembles a horse\'s mouth.\r\nAfter an overnight bus journey, we reached the town from where we had to start the trek. From the town, there is a 6-7 km drive to reach the point from where one can get a permit for the trek. The 6 km drive is very bumpy as there is no asphalt road. The road was muddy and slippery due to the previous night’s heavy rains. But to our amazement, the jeep driver was very confident of his driving skills. The 6km Jeep drive gives a glimpse of the beautiful national park ahead.\r\nAfter reaching the starting point we freshen up and have breakfast at a local homestay. The homestay offers a beautiful view of the valley. Sitting there by the window I started wondering how much fun it would be to have this place as a summer home.\r\nWe started our trek at 11 a.m. and were instructed to be back before 6 p.m. by forest authorities. Initially, the trek seemed easy. For the first four kilometers, it was an easy hike with many small waterfalls and water streams to cross.\r\n  \r\nI do not know whether it was the oil or the weather, but no leech bit me But others did get some leech bites. After the first 4 km, we got our first glimpse of the Kudremukh peak. The ascend then became steep. We decided to take some rest and catch our breath. Since then I lost the sense of time. I did not want to reach at the top first instead I wanted to stop every now and then to experience the beauty before me.\r\n \r\nSo I took a few small breaks before reaching the top. The peak looked so close but it was getting steep and it was a very exhausting climb to the top. Finally, we made to the top at around 3:00 p.m. The feeling of reaching the top is bliss. That is what keeps one motivated to walk further and not give up. But unfortunately, there were a few fellow trekkers who could not reach the top. Maybe because it was their first experience of trekking and even after trekking 6-7 km the peak still looked distant to them and they all decided to not go any further. Those of us who reached the top decided to have our packed lunches as we all were really hungry after four hours of trekking.\r\n \r\nAfter a mouthwatering meal, we all decided to roam around and click pictures. We wanted to stay a little longer at the top before starting our descend. However one cannot predict the weather in the mountains. Suddenly it started raining cats and dogs. We were not expecting this. Though we all were carrying our raincoats still we were not prepared for this heavy rainfall. We started to trek down slowly. It was steep and slippery. The path was not at all rocky, it was all muddy. One has to be extra careful in order to not fall. Few people fell down several times during the descend. I am always very confident when trekking downhill. I thought the difficult part was over now and we have only 11 km to trek down. But it was taking longer than usual to trek down because it was all muddy and slippery. While going up we had seen a sign board stating Kudremukh -- 5km. On our way back we all were waiting for the board to appear but it did not. We kept moving and asking each other about the board as the way is quite plain thereon. It took us a good 3 hours to reach that point. Few people in our group decided to play Frisbee as it was a big green plain.\r\n \r\nI did not stop there as I knew it would be dark before we reach our homestay. Soon it started getting dark and it was still raining. I was trekking all alone. I do not enjoy trekking when soaked in rain. After almost twenty minutes I heard familiar voices. That was a sigh of relief. I was relieved to know that even if it was dark at least I had some company. Finally, around 7 we all managed to reach the forest department office. The starting point of our trek. It was pitch dark outside and we all were completely drenched and our shoes were filled with mud. But in the end that 22kms long trek in the heavy rainfall was worth it. I witnessed the beauty of the Deccan in Monsoon and met some amazing people.\r\nAs someone rightly said.\r\n“At the end of the day your feet should be dirty, your hair should be messy and your eyes sparkling.”\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),

In the Laccadive Sea, there are groups of islands situated.\r\nDo you know what the meaning of Lakshadweep is, it stated for “one hundred thousand islands.” It is the smallest territory of India, where 36 islands are situated. The place is popular for its beaches and landscape.\r\nIt is really a very beautiful place to go to. I and my friends visited many hill stations, but for now, we wanted something new, so we planned to go Lakshadweep trip this time.\r\nHow to reach?\r\nLakshadweep is something very interesting to visit, so we first planned about how we will reach there. It is up to one’s choice that either they want to go via ship or via a flight.\r\nThe distance from New Delhi to Lakshadweep is 1849 km. Lakshadweep itself does not have any station. The nearest station from Lakshadweep is Kochi (Cochin), which is about 361 km away from Lakshadweep.\r\nWe booked our tickets in IndiGo, Air India from Delhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport, which can cost up to 5000 INR to 10000 INR to reach Kochi. There are many flights and water routes that can take the person to Lakshadweep.\r\nIf you are planning for a trip for Lakshadweep from Mumbai, it is only 972 km.\r\nFor the Lakshadweep trip from Bangalore, it is near about 400 km.\r\nLakshadweep trip from Kochi, it is 384 km.  \r\nLakshadweep trip from Mangalore, it is 365 km.\r\nIn Lakshadweep\r\nNow we are in Lakshadweep, and our exciting and nature-loving trip started here.

There was a beach resort, and when we got in touch with the aura of that place, we planned to stay there for the night in that particular resort.\r\nThere is no much population located.

(99, 'Lakshadweep', 'https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/LAKSHADWEEP-ISLANDS.jpg', 'Lakshadweep Diaries – A Journey to the Paradise\r\nwritten by Sayantan January 28, 2019\r\nDid I say paradise? Yes I did because paradise it is indeed. With its exotic and sun-kissed beaches and lush green landscape, Lakshadweep is  a sight for sore eyes. It is an endless series of beautiful pristine white sand beaches, colorful underwater world and coral gardens that will take your breath away. The best part however is that it still retains its offbeat tag which means that it never really gets crowded here. There is no tourist mania to disturb the peace and tranquility of the place. Lakshadweep still is what it has been for ages; a beautiful gem hidden away far out in the sea. A paradise whose beauty I was fortunate enough to witness.\r\nLakshadweep Diaries – The planning\r\n“So”, quipped my friend Arka, “what’s the plan for this Puja”. As busy doctors,we find only the few Durga Puja holidays for a gateway from this mundane life.\r\nRelishing on my plate of sorse Bata Hilsa(Hilsa fish curry), I jokingly suggested,”Mauritius”. But Mauritius was far too costly for us (we are poor government doctors), so we settled, after much deliberation, for Lakshadweep Islands instead.\r\nAfter a flurry of mails and phone calls to SPORTS (the official organization that organizes everything in Lakshadweep), we finalized our itinerary.\r\nThe Pre-Journey\r\nOur plan was to fly to Kochi via Chennai, and then from Kochi to Agatti. From Agatti, we would go to Kadmat for 3nights and then Bangaram for 1night; before catching the flight back to Agatti. (You cannot stay at Agatti and Bangaram is the most costly island to stay!)\r\nAfter a near flight miss at Chennai (due to our foolishness of going for a sightseeing in Chennai and being caught up in the rain), we reached Kochi. The Air India flight from Kochi to Agatti was uneventful.\r\nTip 1: Take a window seat in the flight. The islands and the small Agatti runaway looks wonderful from the skies.\r\nTip 2: Preserve your boarding pass; as you will have to show it at the exit of Agatti airport to gain access to the island. I learnt it the hard way as I had to go back and ransack the entire plane topsy-turvy; only to find that it was all along in my camera bag.\r\nTip 3: Never ever trust SPORTS and the weather.\r\nThe SPORTS manager informed us that due to rough seas, it was not possible to go to Kadmat; or any other island apart from Bangaram (which was an hour journey).\r\nAfter much heated arguments, we finally realized that in Rome do as the Romans do. So we were packed in a minivan, brought to the jetty and offloaded in a Fishing boat; a sturdy one but not the High Speed Caterman as promised.\r\nAfter a rough choppy ride in which most of us became sea sick, we could see the swaying coconut trees on a white pristine beach surrounded by a greenish florescent blue lagoon.\r\nTip 4: Take anti-emetic medications before the boat ride. The best therapy for sea sickness is drinking sea water (it’s not a joke)\r\nBangaram Island\r\nThe idea that we were marooned on this uninhabited small island called Bangaram made us super excited. It is in fact completely uninhabited. Only the SPORTS persons stay in the tourist season and abandon it during monsoon season. It is hardly a kilometer in length, and 500 meters wide. You will be provided with a map of the island by SPORTS, for your own Robinson Cruso moment. We were only 10-15 people on the island and it felt like being “cast away”.\r\nThere are lots of activities provided by SPORTS like scuba diving, PADI certified 5day scuba diving course, snorkeling, deep sea snorkeling, Turtle watch, Island hopping to Tinnakarna, and ship wreck snorkeling etc.\r\nTip 5: Do them all while you are here. they are dam cheap compared to international standards. And the SPORTS people are the most encouraging and professional.\r\nTip 6: You do not need to know swimming to do water sports activities; trust me it is true.\r\nTip 7: The world below the water is far more beautiful than the world above.\r\nTip 8: Have a walk around the island. There are some secluded romantic spots; and a wonderful beach in the west side to enjoy a beautiful sunset.\r\n \r\nAfter an eventful day, we had a sumptuous lunch (full of sea fish and other sea foods) and had a chat with a Australian- French couple and who had come for Yatching. And thus ended our first day of the trip at Bangaram Island.\r\nOther Tips\r\nTip 9: You will be ”advised” in Agatti that you should not wear “skimpy” clothes in Lakshadweep (it being a Muslim majority region). I saw some foreigners wearing bikini in Bangaram still though but I would strongly advise against it. You should respect the feelings of the local people\r\nTip 10: Take kids at your own judgement. We had a couple from Bangalore with a 5 year kid who was more adventurous than the rest of us in the whole trip. Whereas a 6 year old kid along with his parents had to be evacuated after staying only for one day at Bangaram as the kid refused to eat anything.\r\nKadamat – The Coral Garden\r\nAfter being marooned for 2 days in the Bangaram islands; we were finally informed that the boat to Kadmat (again a fishing boat) was ready to leave the next day.\r\nAfter an 8 hour journey in the vast ocean through some choppy waters and warm sunshine, we finally reached Kadmat. It is a much larger and inhabited island; with the resort area at one end of the island, two private beaches at both ends, an old jetty to relax and a small forest to get lost.\r\n \r\nThe real beauty of Kadmat is the coral forests that you can admire by deep sea snorkeling. You can also go for deep sea Tuna fishing in one of the fishing boats (the real Macho thing to do) or Lagoon fishing (a childish thing, but still exiting, and you can eat your catch at dinner). Spend the evening by cycling in the village, walk in the pristine sand beach, and be romantic with your loved ones, hand in hand watching the sunset.\r\nTip 11: Lakshadweep literally means 1 lakh islands,but actually only a few is open for tourists (Bangaram, Kadmat, Tinnakarna, Kavaratti, Minicoy, Anini) My advise will be to stick to the ones near to Agatti,ie.Bangaram and Kadmat. Do not miss these two at any cost.\r\nThe return journey\r\nWe woke up at 3 am; and made our way to the jetty for our return trip to Agatti (again on a shipping boat). The General Manager of Kadmat tourism personally came to see us off; (in spite of the fact that he had lost his sister the day before).\r\nWith the evening star and the milky way above our heads; and the dark turbulent waters rocking our small boat in this vast ocean; I realized how insignificant man is with all his superior intelligence; and cunning in comparison to this beautiful fearsome nature. It was the most memorable journey of my life.\r\nWhat I liked\r\nThe beauty, both above and below the sea.\r\nThe hospitality of the Lakshadweep people and SPORTS, truly remarkable.\r\nThe food and stay\r\nWhat I did not like\r\nThe transport in shipping boats\r\nBasic facts\r\nThe entry to Lakshadweep islands is restricted. One requires an entry permit issued by Lakshadweep Administration to visit these islands.\r\nOnly BSNL and Airtel provides telecommunication services to Lakshadweep Islands. BSNL provides connectivity in all 10 inhabited islands where as Airtel provides connectivity to Kavaratti and Agatti islands.\r\nIslands of Kadmat and Kavaratti have Resorts with AC and Non AC standard; and Deluxe suits available for accommodation.\r\nOnly non-AC tents are available in Islands of bangaram and Thinnakara.\r\nThere are a few privately run resorts in Agatti.\r\nSPORTS does not have any options of accommodation here.\r\nThere is a bit of a risk for booking accommodation with private resorts; since a permit issued by Sports is required to stay on any Island. There have been a few instances in the past when a booking was made with a private resort; and SPORTS refused to issue the permit was not provided. So, it is wise to choose to stay on islands where SPORTS has setup accommodation.\r\nTourists can also choose cruise packages where the overnight stay is provided on the ships; and the visitors are ferried to the islands during the day time.\r\nBest Season: September end to February\r\nMonsoon package also available\r\nSamudram is a ship based package which is less costly, more touristy but unpredictable. Bangaram too is not included in this package.\r\nAll tour plans to be approved by SPORTS beforehand\r\nConclusion\r\nI hope the travelogue above and information on visiting Lakshadweep Islands was of help. If you have any other questions; or need any further information; please feel free to ask in the comments section below; or at our Community Forum; and I will be glad to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(100, 'Lakshadweep', 'https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/LAKSHADWEEP-ISLANDS.jpg', 'LAKSHADWEEP, A Paradise Of Islands\r\n 11th Nov 2017\r\nBy Kritharth Pendyala\r\nFOREWORD:\r\nA trip to Lakshadweep is one of its kind, thanks to all the planning and several things to have in mind before the final countdown to the trip. Plan well in advance and ensure you have a good 45 days before you take your flight or ship onward from Kochi. It needs a lot of papertrail and effort in order to clear the entry formalities. Lakshadweep is one of the few places in India that requires a visitor’s entry permit. To enter the Union Territory of Lakshadweep as a traveller, you require an entry manifest issued by the Administrator’s Office in Kochi, Willingdon Island. Do keep in mind that the permit is the most important document to visit Lakshadweep Islands. This is one such trip where I thought that the precursor to the trip is as exciting as the trip itself, a lot of planning and prepping isn’t always good, but as I said, the trip to Lakshadweep is one of a kind! To obtain the permit, you either need to have contact access with a local travel agent in Kochi, or go to Kochi personally and get the permit issued. Permits require certain documents, which may be quite a task to obtain, but believe me, it is definitely worth the effort! You require a police clearance certificate issued by the local police station, whose jurisdiction you live in. Mumbai police aren’t very helpful in this regard, for they did not know the procedure at all. This certificate has to be submitted to the office in Willingdon Island who will issue the permits. Married couples can be accomodated on a single permit whereas all others travellers would require a seperate permit. There is also an option to skip this entire procedure and book your trip with the government authorised tourism department named SPORTS, Lakshadweep Tourism which is a part of Lakshadweep Government. They will issue a permit which is in total accordance with your itinerary, and guess what, you don’t require to submit any document whatsoever if you book through them. We chose to go with SPORTS, and it was very breezy to obtain the entry manifest/permit. Going ahead with a travel agent will seem easy, but with the experience we had, going through SPORTS, was the best decision of our trip. They have access and internal contacts everywhere(Boats,any special requirements,etc.). The food, service, and their will to always welcome people is simply brilliant. So please be well informed that visiting Lakshadweep and experiencing it through SPORTS, is the best way possible. Booking through SPORTS is costly, but worth because of the beautiful properties they own in each of the islands. Alliance Air, the regional wing of AirIndia, operates the only flight to Agatti Island. This is a morning flight from Kochi. Landing on the Agatti airstrip is an experience in itself, because the tiny ATR which is loaded with only about 80% of its entire capacity lands on a 1200 metre runway, making it the one of the most difficult places to land in the world!!! Get yourself booked on window seats for the best experience preferably in the first half of the aircraft. Please keep in mind, that the connectivity is limited to Airtel and BSNL in Agatti, Kavaratti and Bangaram, and only BSNL in all other islands. Do not expect anything over 2G internet. Some of the SPORTS resorts have WiFi connectivity, subject to network availability.\r\nDay 1\r\nAgatti Airport\r\nKochi to Agatti and Kavaratti\r\n(11th November 2017):\r\nYet to recover from the amazing landing here at Agatti airstrip, stunned by the silence of the emerald isle of India, you will find yourself in Lakshadweep. A group of 36 coral islands, with 10 of them being inhabited and only 6 of them open for tourism, The Union Territory of Lakshadweep is the most pristine and virgin beach destination in India. Agatti is not open for tourism, so all that you can do is a day trip here. Some of the best turquoise beaches, lagoon shores and coral reef walls and fine white coral sand are owned by Lakshadweep. Trust me, A blog or even some photographs do not do justice to the place, you have to breathe here to actually sink in the feel!!! We had to move to Kavaratti, but some delay in the vessel timings ensured that we had a great daytrip at Agatti, visiting all the places. SPORTS will treat you extremely well, ensuring everything is in order and planned out well in advance. High speed AC vessels or crafts as they are called are most commonly used to transit from island to island. There is a schedule, which is published and strictly adhered to, by the government. After lunch we departed for Kavaratti. It takes 2 hours by the high speed vessel. The SPORTS resort is right in the centre of the island pretty much near to the jetty. It is a beautiful property facing the lagoon beach. Crystal clear waters of the Laccadives Sea are calm inside the lagoon, but ferocious once you are out in the open sea. It was already evening by then. A view of the sunset, a walk round the village, and some quiet relaxing time by the beach ended our first day in Lakshadweep!\r\nDay 3\r\nKadmat Island\r\nKavaratti to Kadmat\r\n(13th November 2017):\r\nThe vessel was scheduled to leave Kavaratti at 6.30am. We reached Kadmat at 11am. Kadmat is also an inhabited island with a population of 7000. We spent our time lazing around and basking in the sun. The property of SPORTS is huge here. It has a private beach with several hammocks and a wide variety of activities. A windy evening was the perfect set-up for a Yacht ride with the sails onboard. It was more of a topsy-turvy ride full of thrill. We returned to the shore by sunset. To top it all, a lovely dinner followed, by the beach side. This day was more of a leisure filled day just for relaxing!\r\nDay 4\r\nKadmat Island\r\nKadmat\r\n(14th November 2017):\r\nWaking up to a beautiful sunrise, with two groups of dolphins welcoming us to this beautiful archipelago of coral lagoons was no short of a dream! The waters in Kadmat are home to a wide variety of marine life. Beautiful corals and some awesome sights of fish in water compelled me to go for another SCUBA dive here, in the open sea. Diving in the open sea is one of the best experiences in the world, and Lakshadweep stands amongst the best places to go for an open dive. This particular dive-site had a view to a 40 metre deep trench which is clearly visible. You can see several schools of fish in complete harmony and swimming all across in the same rhythm, and its just so silent that you feel you are in a completely different world altogether. This is a lifetime experience and I would definitely try to have a go at it in all the different seas across the world. We went for a village tour in the evening and witnessed some octopus hunting by the local beach folk. The resort officials were kind enough to arrange for a local traditional dance program in the evening, which had the real taste of the Laccadive culture. This event was followed by dinner and we were off to retire for the day.\r\nDay 5\r\nBangaram\r\nKadmat to Bangaram\r\n(15th November 2017):\r\nOur day started pretty early at 4.00am, we had to board a speed boat to reach Bangaram, the next island on our trip. We reached Bangaram by 8.00am in the morning. Bangaram was the most beautiful island in our trip, because of the excellent views it has on offer. Calling it gorgeous would be an understatement, making it a must visit place on one’s itinerary to Lakshadweep. It is totally uninhabited, which means there is nobody on this island except for travellers who choose to visit Bangaram and the staff of the resort. The water periphery here matches the colour of the clouds, so one cannot identify the partition between the clouds and the ocean at Bangaram. It is that beautiful. White sands, pristine waters, deep blue and turquoise waters are a common sight in Lakshadweep, but for people like us, who are a part of continuous urban pandemonium, it will take a while to sink in. Bangaram Island Resort has thatched roof huts for accomodation. We went for a turtle chase, where we chase the turtles in a speed boat, and when the turtle is tired, it comes up to the water surface to breathe, and then we can see it entirely. We also went for a shipwreck snorkel activity which is exclusive to the Bangaram island. There is a shipwreck of more than a hundred years old which is home to a lot of marine life. The site of the shipwreck itself is an entire ecosystem. There are corals growing on the rusted iron grids of the ship. It is nature’s wonder and its power that creates a wrecked and damaged piece of waste, useful to various forms of life. Once in Bangaram, the shipwreck snorkel is an activity, one must go for. A serene sunset and some time along the beach was followed by a sumptuous local dinner. We can see bio-luminiscent plankton here on the beach at Bangaram, they shine and emit blue coloured light which is simply divine to see. Of all the other beaches only this lagoon beach at Bangaram is home to such micro-organisms, and they can clearly be seen in the silent darkness of the night. Lakshadweep fulfilled many of my bucketlist checkpoints that I thought were barely possible owing to the damage and impact we’ve had on our environment, it feels really proud to have such a beautiful destination in India.\r\nDay 6\r\nBangaram\r\nBangaram\r\n(16th November 2017):\r\nWaking up to the beauty of Bangaram, and a beautiful sunrise, we spent some time lazing around on the pristine beach. From Bangaram, you can clearly see atleast 3 different shades of water in the Laccadives Sea, indicating the depth in each region. I went for another SCUBA dive, this time in one of the best places in Lakshadweep for SCUBA. The dive masters zeroed in on a dive site known as the Shallow point. It is 12m deep and has a variety of marine species. Visibility was low, but I enjoyed every moment of my underwater dive, in the silence of the deep sea and the under-water world. SCUBA drains you of energy, but it also leaves you yearning for more time underwater. A relaxed and a beachy evening followed. The sunset point is at the back of the island and it gets really scenic during the evenings, which is a low tide period and there is a sand bank near the island which you can reach by wading through knee-deep crystal clear water. There are several hermit crabs which are really beautiful to see on this island. Another day on this beautiful set of islands ended with a beach side dinner.\r\n\r\nDay 7\r\nThinnakara\r\nManta Point Dive and Thinnakara\r\n(17th November 2017):\r\nThinnakara is really close to Bangaram and you can reach there in 15 minutes from Bangaram. I had planned another dive at a fantastic dive site to spot sharks. This was the Manta Point. It lies to the North-East of Bangaram, and has some very good shark sightings. Soon we were 12 metres underwater and once we went towards the actual point, there was a huge stingray basking on the sand underwater, also the divemaster who was assisting me with the dive had pointed out towards a deeper point, and there was a mid size white tip shark. The effort and time was finally worth it, once we were up and floating after the dive was over, it took me a couple of hours to recover from the fantastic experience that I had just been in! We had reached the last leg of our trip and headed to Thinnakara for the last few hours on this heaven in India. Thinnakara is also an uninhabited island. The resort in Thinnakara will accomodate you only in tents, and it is a nice experience to stay in one of them. The beach at Thinnakara cannot be enjoyed completely because there is too much of seaweed that is washed onto the shore, owing to the location of the island. The water is brown because of the moss and algae accumulation, but this does not take anything away from the island or the waters of Lakshadweep, because they are clean as ever with pure white coral sand and crystal clear water all around. We went to a small secluded island which is right next to Thinnakara. It is called Bada Parali. There is also a smaller island called Chotta Parali nearby. Both of these are also uninhabited. Walking and wading through the water is a fantastic experience as we could see a lot of sea-cucumbers, and baby eels. The water is as clear as it can get, so you can see the underwater life. As the darkness of the night approached, I could sense the last day in Lakshadweep come to an end.\r\n\r\nDay 8\r\nAgatti Airport\r\nThinnakara to Bangaram/Agatti and the return back to Kochi\r\n(18th November 2017):\r\nWe left in the local boat for Bangaram and from there onto a high speed craft for Agatti, to catch our flight back to Kochi and eventually enter into the urban cacophony of Bombay. With a strong will to come back to this beautiful archipelago again, our trip ended!!!\r\nA CLOSING NOTE ON LAKSHADWEEP, IT\'S PEOPLE, AND WHAT IT OFFERS FOR TRAVELLERS:\r\nWe should be proud of the fact that Lakshadweep is a part of India, and promote tourism to these islands.\r\nBe prepared to be in awe of the beaches, the sand, the lagoons, the coral life and reefs, the marine life and everything else.\r\nTry to spend most of your time underwater since it is a completely different world down there!!!\r\nThe people of Lakshadweep take their hospitality and tourism very seriously and hence they are the most courteous bunch of people we can ever find. They will readily accept any demand put forth by the guests. They are the nicest people I have come across from all the various regions I have visited. I can say that I have definitely made a few friends there!\r\nSince everything comes from the mainland, there is very little available here, please try not to waste anything in these beautiful islands!\r\nPlease visit the below link for further details and mail them for your stay at Lakshadweep, it has details of the government operated tourism office.\r\nDay 2\r\nKavaratti Island Beach Resort\r\nKavaratti\r\n(12th November 2017):\r\nKavaratti is the capital of the union territory of Lakshadweep. It is inhabited and has a population of about 12000. It has a few shops and clear signs of settlement. It houses most of the government offices, has a good hospital and 2 Air-Ambulances for an emergency on any island. The locals have to bring everything from the mainland(Kochi), since there are only 2 things available locally, coconuts and fish. The morning was set aside for watersports. We snorkelled and I went for my first SCUBA Dive. I had to go for the try-dive with a 3 metre depth, because of the rough weather conditions in the open sea outside the lagoon. It helped in a way because it was my first time. You can see a completely different world altogether, underwater. It is so amazing and beautiful in a way that cannot be conceived by anything, except the mind and that too only with a firsthand experience!!! It was so beautiful, that it took me an entire day to recover from this beautiful and enthralling hangover. We spent some time around the village, visiting the lighthouse, and a local hatchery. We quickly retired for the night, to leave for Kadmat next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n');
